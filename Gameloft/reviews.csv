com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftA8HM,"[""It's a great game, great racing experience, takes time to master, and lots of fun once you get good, fast cars. The only problem is that getting good cars can be a long process unless you're willing to spend real money, and even then, there's a lot of grinding involved in order to obtain currency and parts that you need to purchase and upgrade new cars. I just wish that they would make it easier to obtain new cars and not make it so difficult to progress in this game. It would be SO much better."", ""This game is amazing, but after a while of not playing it I came back to see a big difference in the ui, and it just makes everything slower, and also the way there's character animations now just kinda make it feel a bit more like a pubg ad at the end of races somehow, I don't really know what it is it used to bring me so much nostalgia till the update :( Still fun to play and I'm sure that a lot of other people prefer the new layout but I personally rhink a classic mode or something would help"", 'Super fun, and I really appreciate them keeping this updated and active despite there being a newer version. Controls are easy to make comfortable, fun and easy to play on both PC and mobile, relatively realistic with stats and physics to my knowledge. An interesting variety of maps and race types, great music. I honestly prefer it to Asphalt 9 because it feels easier to navigate and more user-friendly', ""Excellent game, high frame rate, no play limit, and menus are easy to navigate. I highly recommend this game for casual gamers. Just focus on getting a really fast car, and you will have adrenaline speed fun for hours! I wanted to rate this games 5 stars, but I don't like that alot of the cool cars require tokens to get, which are almost impossible to obtain without making an in-app purchase."", ""Overall, this game is really well designed. The graphics are very realisitic and I love how you made Credits that are just like Coins. Maybe make some different tracks because it's boring just going on the same tracks. Also, can you make an update where you play like a parkour where you have to go over jumps or something. And if you finish top 3 or something you get 500 Credits or maybe a New Car Unlocked. Like I said, I really love this game and I would recommend it."", ""It's a a awesome game with an imaginative twist, actual cars with real upgrades makes it that much more enjoyable. So many tracks and bonus features, you can never get bored. The bonus features make it that much more possible to gain position against the feirce composition. Have Fun and don't be afraid to take out the composition."", ""This is one game I've been playing for a while. Very addictive lol! I would give it a solid five stars however, I can do without the freezes. Also it would be great if the timer for the boost didn't start before the race begins and stop after the race ends. It's kind of a rip off that the timer starts before the race begins and waiting for other players to join i.e multiplayer and continues after the race ended."", ""With all the new improvements and class rework, I would say this game is worth getting. Its fun, action packed, and an overall amazing game. With it being compatible with keyboard, touch, or controller. I'd say this is pretty cross-platform. I will admit it can be very grinding heavy."", 'Between iOS and android ive been Playing Asphalt 8 for years. I would love to give this a 5 star review, but however cannot. My only issue are the Atrocious ads. I would love to pay for something if it were to permanently remove ads. I reached out to customer service through the app and was told that some purchases ""might remove ads temporarily So be sure to Keep checking the shop for desired deals"". However, none ofthe ""deals"" in the shop mention anyting about removing ads. Unplayable as is.', ""I used to think this was a good game, now I'm not so sure. For one, its really bad when the only way to get credits is by racing or spending actual money. And that brings me to my second point. When you actual do spend your money, the game will say transaction failed because of poor connection even though your connection is fine, and yet Google Play will still process your purchase! So now, your out however many dollars you spent to make the purchase, and yet you have nothing to show for it!!"", ""I played this game a year or two after it's release and it was great but now it's changed for the worse. You used to be able to use bikes in normal campaign which they removed and the new menu interface sucks compared to the old one. The adds used to only be after races now everytime I back out of a setting or after upgrading a car it gives me an add which is too excessive. Honestly this was an amazing game when it was first released now it's garbage. This app has not aged well. Unistalled."", 'The graphics are pretty and the controller support is good. Beyond that this game is not worth anyone\'s time unless you plan on spending massive amounts of real money. Like most ""progress as you go"" race games, you start out with your typical slow beginner car and are supposed to eventually tune it and tweak it and eventually buy other faster cars to continue to participate in events both career and multiplayer. Unfortunately the only way you\'re going to be able to do that is to spend a lot of your real cash to upgrade cars or spend many many hours repeating the same courses over and over again until your eyes bleed so you can farm the money you need to buy cars that have even half a chance against the established field of competition. After watching youtube videos on strategy I spent over $60 USD to try to follow the plan to success and my beginning cars are not even halfway to their full potential of upgrades and lightyears behind anyone I get paired with on anything multiplayer. The dollar amounts keep more than doubling to upgrade the cars to the next level and the amount of hours I\'m looking at to even put a dent in the upgrades I ""need"" to keep going is just ridiculous. If I wanted to punch the same buttons over and over again, day after day with no end in sight, I would go get a factory job. Even at minimum wage it would be more rewarding than being able to brag about how fast my pretend car is after wasting real big chunks of my real time to get it. I\'m just the silly one who thinks if a game is about racing fast cars you should be able to install it and race a fast car. I\'m already broke and wish I had a different car in real life. I don\'t need Gameloft\'s help in pretending to be poor in a game too.', ""I love this game, too much maybe. I don't have any problems with it. Some cars are very expensive, but thats expected from a high graphic racing game, especially the best on the appstore (in my opinion.) It'd be nice if there was a way to drive on the levels with no other racers, for practice, like a freestyle mode. Awesome that this game is free!"", ""Its fun, but the difficulty needs re-adjusted. There are so many paths to take it gets confusing. Also, I bought the car pack for $5 and the cars it gave me aren't even good... The D-class starting car is way better than my purchased D-class, and I even tuned the purchased car more. I feel ripped off. It took me umpteen tries to win the second race because the game is unbalanced. Opponents are faster even with tune-ups and can take shortcuts that are easy to miss and just leave you in the dust."", ""It's a cool game and it runs smoothly during races but it takes forever to load the rest of the features like modifications, features, and the downloaded content for the quick races. I have a cheep phone running it, though. I don't even have service and I have to run on free WiFi, so it's may be my problem and not the game. I really like it, the pros outweigh the cons. Thanks for your hard work Gameloft!!!ð¿ï¸"", 'Great game, though be prepared to set your device down and wait 30 sec after some races in career mode. Watching the ad is optional, but doing so will at least double the credits earned (usually more like 10x or 15x) It is a little bit of a pay-to-win, if you want to be really good at the events, but thats not the ges fault. Its only because your competing against other players who have already paid money to get extra boosts and stuff. Overall, it is a great game, highly recommend.', ""This game is is good, Very good I like the graphics and the racing. It also has good handling so you can win the race it is kind of hard at the same time because you crash a lot but it is still the best game. Also it could need some upgrades because like sometimes bugs and stuff like that. Also it lags when you go to the next car because there's a lot of cars. But it's a good game!!!ðð"", ""1 of the best racing games I've played on my phone. Great graphics, control's, spectacular sceneries, fabulous cars to drive fast with and do tricks with. Sometimes there is a little bit of a lag with Multi player load screens, and doing the free videos for items. You guys need to bring back the rest of the car's so I can add them to my collection."", ""Asphalt 8 is arcade racing game. It has various maps, modes, cars, and fun gameplay experience. Vehicles fall in different categories depending on what each car can offer. Each vehicle can be upgraded to improve its performance in a race. If you upgraded your vehicles high enough, you can be matched up with other cars in higher tier. My issue is it's credit system. Everything is expensive and it forces you to purchase credits or tokens with actual money to purchase some virtual car. 6/10"", ""Way too many ads. The cars are cool, the races are fun, but the interrupting ads every 60 to 90 seconds are too much. Update: they changed it again. The pro upgrades are now virtually impossible for those who don't pay to play. I don't spend much time playing any more. Update 5/2020: updates take forever to download, and now the fusion coins make it impossible to upgrade a car. Playing less and less often."", 'This is a perfect balance between pay to win and the complete opposite! The game doesnt force you to need to pay for certain vehicles(although they are expensives). Even then, the game is reliant on your skill and not how fast you go. And unlike a good majority of racing or fighting games, this game in particular ranks your car with others! It is very rare to see unfair advantages due to this. I can only say to make all events accessible with any cars.', 'The game itself is well made with nice graphics, controls and a huge variety of cars. Marketing this game as free to play is nothing more than a blatant lie. I have been playing the game with the same car for about a season and a half because saving up enough in game currency for a new car that is actually viable is not possible. I have also been racing this 1104 ranked car against 1250 ranked cars because the upgrades are expensive. Of course, if you spend LOTS of money all these issues go away', ""The game has great graphics, and the controls on PC are simple to learn. The game doesn't allow you to advance in career pass 10 stars. When you go to commence the race for the Audi R8 Tron the game silent crashes. Also I would say that a great deal of finance is needed to gain more advanced vehicles aside from the occasional festival. The multiplayer mode is good but the rewards are not worth the time investment necessary to obtain them. That aside the game is fun but not worth the money input"", ""New multi-player sucks!! I have only won once out of over 5 dozen attempts. Used to win or place 2nd on numerous occasions. The new format makes it impossible. Used to love playing this game...until they added all of the ads that pop up when trying to start a race or navigate to different screens. Its exhausting now...considering deleting app if the frequency of ads doesn't go back to how it was before. I don't mind an ad here and there, but not everytime I try to select something."", ""It's a great game, but it glitches many times throughout my experience. For starters, I can only upgrade a feature for a car (Eg: speed, braking) once, before it tells me I need to check my internet connection, although it's working fine. I've noticed throughout other features in the game as well, and wish this could be fixed. If there's any way I can help fix this, I'm here to help."", ""This was a very cool game but after the Feb. 12 update ruined it. Now the game takes forever to load. After it finally loads, I might be able to play for a very short bit and then the game CRASHES!! It repeatedly crashes when I try to restart the app and now I can't even get into the game! Tried uninstalling and then reinstalling but that does nothing. Still crashes! Once I got excited because it started to load, but then took a long time to load only to crash after just few minutes of play!"", ""The graphics are great. Starting the game is confusing and lacks information on how to proceed. So much so that I uninstalled the game before completing the setup....I think. It took me to a screen to subscribe but didn't tell me anything except how many other had subscribed. What would I be subscribing to??? Your guess, my guess. Then a screen with a menu but what the heck is what, again no info or not instructions or direction of any kind. I don't have time for guessing games."", ""Awesome game but...I don't know if it's my tablet or the game it's self but it keeps crashing. With it still being a very good game it needs a bit of work, instead of giving decals we should be able to customize the cars to our liking. The music needs to be dated, (I like to listen to good music while playing.) Overall very good game hands down."", ""DON'T DO IT. THE GAME IS DEAD. I can't describe how bad it is now and it isn't one of those things where you can still have fun once you get serious. Earnings are down, every good or decent thing takes stupid amounts real money, cars and event progress was reset, and ever car requires wayyy too much time to grind for. If they reset your progress to make you spend more money once, they can do it again. I have lost all trust in the game and developer. You killed a racing legend. Asphalt 9 is meh."", ""Yikes I miss the old game. The ads aren't that bad in my opinion because I have seen worse but the true problem is that every single car is insanely overpriced. Some cars are double or triple the amount of credits then they were before. Also the career is unrealistic that you have to get every single star to progress in the season and it wasn't like that before. The UI is very nice and the new cars are cool but please just make everything priced the same as before, you'll get more players back."", 'A well rounded racing game. The controls are simple, the races are fun. And for a mobile game, this has some of the best graphics I have seen in a long time. four stars only because of some bugs that cause my car to freeze during a multiplayer race. Which is extrememly annoying as it allows my opponents to pass me.', ""This is probably the best free racing game on the play store. I would even say it's better than most payed racing games. The controls are great with a large selection of styles to pick from, the graphics are stunning for mobile, and it runs really well for how good it looks. Only downside is that progression can be pretty slow at times, replaying the same races constantly to scrape credits together to unlock new races. I would recommend this to anyone with even a slight interest in racing games."", ""Good racing game, fast paced & exciting. The cars are spot on for a game. More than enough to do, events, daily specials, select car races, multiplayer etc. Get to paint the car or do graphics, tuning in 4 areas & a pro mode tuning. Never the less, A few weeks into the game and without spending real money I'd have to say that I'm done with it & will be deleting it. It's a huge game & not worth keeping if your not playing on a regular basis."", 'Cars, good. Play, good. Graphics, good. Sound effects, good. Upgrades were strange/unrealistic (16 tires for a tire upgrade, you only have 4 wheels.) 2 yrs. ago, but I dealt with it, part of getting your money. After the update before this latest, the one introducing fusion coins, I thought ""what are they thinking?"", and now with their latest update: "" now, they are just way too greedy! They are getting ridiculous! It\'s not worth my time anymore.', ""Such a fun game, but it has so many problems. I use manual acceleration, and the touch zones for the buttons are so small and completely unadjustable that its impossible to get through a race without the game thinking you lifted off the throttle. Also, the controls don't show up until the race actually starts, so its impossible to get a perfect launch like you would with auto acceleration. Finally, too many cars require tokens to buy, and a lot of the game is behind a pseudo-paywall."", ""Insanely great game. The controls for laptop are super easy to use, and are positioned so there is no scrambling and wrong button pushing cuz the keys are so close together. The graphics are one of the best on Google Play. There is no shortage of content. My few complaints are some technical issues. Sometimes the multiplayer can't connect, sometimes u can't collect certain prizes, and there is an option after races to double ur rewards by watching an ad, but it never loads. Would recomend."", ""Really great game. Few things I don't like, is that I wish you could convert tokens into credits, and credits into parts, due to how little credits you earn. I also wish that the cars would do barrel rolls, only when possible. Last thing is I wish that the physics are more realistic; meaning if you land on your side/roof, you don't wreck, unless it's at a high falling speed."", ""I have been playing and enjoying this game for many years. I have rarely had any problems with this game running on my Samsung S3 tablet. It runs well even at the highest graphics setting. After yesterday's updates however, the game continuously crashes every time that I make any changes in the settings which I was able to do before. Clearing the cache and the data seems to fix this temporarily, but means I have to download it again. Please fix this as this update is horrible."", ""This is the best free racing game you'll find on the play store at the moment. The graphics are absolutely great, which means you'll need a high end device to play it comfortably. The gameplay is good, but rehashed from asphalt 8 with very few changes. People complain but the P2W aspect isn't as bad as I've seen it in other games. If you play a bit of everything and get in 10-20 races a day then you'll get daily packs and plenty of gold/premium currency. Takes a good phone and lots of grind."", 'I used to play this game when i was smaller and i loved it. Everything was so much easier, the races, getting credits, buying cars. It was all so much better but the game is still good, it needs to be fixed a small bit just so i dont always have to pay for everything, i would rather enjoy watching an add to get a tuning kit other than having to pay for it.']"
com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftAGHM,"[""I love this game! The graphics, the cars, the different types of races, everything is amazing! The only two things I dislike are: So many cars you have pay real money to get, and that after a race it doesn't show you how many coins you got unless you don't want to retry. I really dislike that last feature, as then you have to go back to main screen and re-enter the race (which takes some time to load.)"", 'The graphics are amazing, and the detail is on point, but what the heck is wrong with the controls??

But years went by and I couldn't get the account on my old tablet to my first phone. No problem. I thought I would just start playing a ton again. The game is much different. Too many ads. Everything I click something it's telling me to not vape and stuff. Overall just annoying"", ""It designed very poorly. The obvious focus was on graphics and as a result The tracks are terribly laid out, the events are not well planned and the overall feel of the game is that the designers didn't care about their project, just the graphics. There are cars where there shouldn't be any, on Italy in particular u can't drift like you're supposed to and even when u do its never clean. China is literally designed to make players wreck. 2 stars both of them are for graphics. But that's all"", ""Altho, this game is gr8, in steering n keeping it steady. Its almost similar to Asphalt 9. The upgrade boxes isn't that easy to get, n boxes go for 10000 coins, or u can win them boxes during some missions or if u get promoted to the next level. 2 things should b change: 1 is spending real cash (instead of game coins) on certain cars to pass a level, n wit the game coins it should b used to purchase upgrade boxes for our cars."", ""It's a cool racing game but it still is necessary to buy stuff to complete. Not all have money to spend and just to play a game. But it does have very good graphics and easy gameplay. If you do not pay them $$$ tgen you will mysteriously wreck.

Its compact, offline (online optional), and an adrenaline rush! I've been playing Nitro for years now. Of all the games on my phone and tablets over the years, this game has remained the longest. You can upgrade your car and unlock new ones, race around the world in exotic locations, and grind through exciting races to unlock kit boxes! I even figured out a bug that allows a player to keep doubling their reward money. I got 34,000 for a 1,000rwd"", ""I have had an amazing experience with this game. I love that it is so similar to the Asphalt series, and that the graphics are still so great for the cars. If you love asphalt, but don't have the storage space, this game is definitely for you.

This game was made before that one so the quality is not as good, less graphical fidelity and harder to do barrel rolls. But the foundation of a fun Asphalt game is still here.

I was looking for something like this, but the pay to play is a bit much and the videos for upgrades don't work anymore.

There is a certain point in the campaign where the secretly doesn't allow your shield to recharge untill you kill all th enemies in the area. This forces you to buy extra armor, etc. to progress.

There is always something to do and many places to go. Both me and my daughter play it. I do have a few critiques though: I don't think clearing items or playing games with the characters to build stars should go up in price. The characters and shops themselves are hard enough to afford, and more than half the time I can't load any advertisements to get it done either. I think it should at least be easier to make more bits and gems if everything is going to get crazy expensive. I also think it's a little too geared on real money as well. You can still play the game well enough without purchasing things, but the advertisements for it pop up in your face all the time.

Didn\'t personally like the minecart. Characters looked cute, but a number were locked behind unlikely odds, whether it was very time-constrained events, gambling (balloons), or ""leaderboards"" on other events. Even when on sale, cost for some other characters were far too much, which would either pressure you to pay up, or spend a lot of time on it to get them. To give you an idea, I spent at least two solid years of playing often daily, and I still couldn\'t afford all of them when they went on sale. Only recently did they partially allivate this issue, but it\'s still a steep hill to climb. I\'ve enjoyed some of the time I spent on the game, and it\'s taught me much about how a mobile game\'s formula works. But to say it\'s worth picking up would be a lie. If there\'s more forgiving special event timers, skill-based social events rather than ""pay more to get extra tries"", and some more in-universe games that make sense, then I might recommend it.', ""I really LOVED this game for a quite some time.

This game feels clunky and slow using manual controls, so it almost feels like if you are not using auto combat, you are not going to succeed.

Constantly using block to counter enemies looks trashy and is about the only challenge to the game. Got bored so fast which is sad because this game took forever on the DL and looks incredible. It's all autopath with 3 sets of enemies per level. Visually epic for a mobile tho."", ""On the one hand, the graphics are downright gorgeous, and I like that you actually wear the armor, not just put it on and the character looks exactly the same. The play is certainly smooth and enjoyable to watch. Unfortunately, I'm not playing games to just watch what happens on screen, I'm paying games to be engaged, and this game suffers from a complete lack thereof, as you'll spend most if not all of your time in auto combat, as there's really no complexity or strategy to combat to begin with but strike and block. I would hardly call this a game of any sort. My biggest issue with the game that I haven't bothered to get involved in is the paid portion. This is consistent across mobile games, that you're sure to be charged positively absurd amounts of your livelihood for absolutely minor product. I wouldn't even call it product, cause it certainly won't last. $100 for 50k gold when I made 20k in a few hours?

It's reaction based combat. You don't actually control your characters movements, but the combat is so fluid you still feel satisfied.

It takes patience to earn potions and tokens but that gives you a reason to check the game every day (or 2, 3, 4, maybe more times depending on your schedule). I've even had my game crash and reset and a quick email with CS had it restored in a few days. This is by far my favorite game and I love getting to customize my park and collect the various characters. I definitely recommend playing DMK!"", 'The game is fun to play, however there are quite a few things that are not great. The app crashes constantly. I have tried everything to fix this, ensuring the app is up to date, closing it completely, turning my phone off, uninstall and reinstall.

I will keep playing but not for long if my app keeps crashing.', 'Have played this game for over a year. I have enjoyed building my kingdom. I\'m not very happy with the new ""wishes/happiness "" controls as it is almost impossible to keep the happiness in the park at ecstatic level. It would be nice to have more land available at lower cost (1,ooo,ooo magic is a bit extreme). Having 25 attractions in storage due to not enough land is disappointing. Other than the few complaints, I do enjoy the game. The graphics are truly amazing.', ""I love everything disney and have been playing for awhile. But this game is sometimes very stressful when your trying to level up or get certain characters or items. Everything costs diamonds and they are hard to get or save up for, unless you want to spend your own money.

It's a good time killer if you dont take the game too seriously or care about progressing at all."", 'In general, my wife and I really enjoy the game. I\'ve rated it lower because I think the creators are getting too greedy as far as forcing players to pay for things with money to advance.

This is backwards, focus should be on EXTERNAL CONTROLLER SUPPORT.

Very quickly you face opponents you cannot beat in free mode. Also actually receiving the daily perks is very hit or miss. This could easily be a 5 star game, but alas I will probably delete as I refuse to pay for basic game play and run out of things to do.', ""The game play, feel, and graphics thus far are excellent. I would rate 5 stars, but the pop up advertising is annoying, and detracts from the game experience. Perhaps an option to opt out of the ads. It's one thing to have an option to watch them to recharge energy, but it is annoying when they just show up in the middle of everything."", 'Good graphics. Love the landscape photos used for the background. Devs are friendly, fast to reply, and quickly resolve any issues. There is no lag whatsoever. Easy to learn, easy to play, difficult to win. Only issue is the same as Modern Warplanes, rewards decrease compared to equipment costs as you progress.', ""This game would have a 5 star if the two issues I've had we're attended to. Couldn't adjust the graphics at all, which was odd to me, at first I could. Then suddenly couldn't. Secondly, I can no longer collect gems from the echelon tournament. Which is something I heavily rely on for progress. Simply because I'm a collector, and have limited time to play. But, the dim side is they've clearly made a good game, but buggy as can be. The Devs don't support this game anymore, according to GameLoft."", ""Great game(5â­), but after encountering a bug I can no longer play multiplayer. Support for this was complete nonsense as the best advice was to ensure that my phone was plugged into the ethernet cable... After asking multiple times for other suggestions and even clearing my cache, storage, reinstalling, and pulling my saved game from the sever; still no multiplayer. The game it self is total fun and we'll balanced but lack of support killed it for me."", ""Gameplay is ok. Simple and fun. However I played 5 matches and when I finally got gear to equip I couldn't do so. Because this game decided to put an AD right over the buttons needed to equip items and upgrade your character. I wouldn't even say it's a stupid design flaw. But more of a greedy decision to place it there. Uninstalling the app."", ""Honestly this game is amazing! I want to thank the developers for actually making a game that is overall enjoyable and playable! It's free, with the option for in game purchases, but they don't hound you to purchase things or make it to where eventually the game is so hard you need to just to advance. The graphics are amazing. Game play is amazing. Choosing between all the different armour/horses/lances/etc and the different looking leagues along with online play keep in interesting and fun!"", ""Nothing would please me more than to rate this game higher. Gameplay is excellent, and I truly, truly want to love it. But there's an issue with this game that I can't ignore: it refuses to hold your save data. I had to go through the tutorial multiple times giving it a chance. This is a simple but important issue, and I have no idea why it exists. May reinstall and give 5 stars if they fix this issue, but I highly doubt they will."", 'One would think that when we develop a unique app that uses controls to operate. We would give great opportunity for the players to practice as much as you want and at their own pace. I found this app to be interesting with great graphics, but to only to have a introduction of how to use the controls one time and only one time. I will not keep this app.', ""Bugs bugs bugs I can't play championship or friendship battles. I constantly lose because of missed targets when getting a perfect strike underneath the opponents armpit. This is the only target area that does this. I never get a missed target anywhere else. And accessing customer service is virtually impossible with the horrific web page design."", 'game is OK. its a bit shallow all the way around from the quality of game play to ability to customize, BUT it does show great potential. good looking game with a good feel. the variety of things to customize is there, but the graphics need refining. the jousting should really be from one perspective all the way through, not 2 different ones. having 2 dif ones takes away from realism and the challenge of focusing the lance thru the charge as the target finally closes to impact. 3 stars', 'Awesome game. One of the most original, realistic games I have played in a while not to mention this is a mobile app!!! Hats off to the developers on this one keep it up yall! Just as good as a console game. Refreshing to finally see games that have 3d gameplay it would be awesome if you could implement the graphics in real time real fighting war battles', 'This game is fun and enjoyable, especially so for one on the mobile market. The dialogue as you progress through the different leagues and interact with more characters leads to amusing encounters. You can unlock premium items through tournaments and events without paying money. I have two major complaints: The target missed glitch has occassionally cost me matches for no good reason. The game does crash randomly but these are usually infrequent.', ""Ads are too much to get over. I used to play this game on my iPhone got pretty far and then downloaded it on my new android. Unfortunately they've added ads in game which really irritates me. I deleted it. I am okay with clicking to watch ads to get free stuff like most games have, but not okay with a banner at the bottom."", ""Interesting take on the jousting genre. I'm actually enjoying it. Lol. Check it out if you have time to kill and can pay attention. The only drawback i have is it's joust, joust, joust. Over and over and over. The special side games are few and far between. If you could add another dimension to the game so the jousting doesn't get boring so quickly, that would increase playability."", 'Love the concept, wish single combat were an option at the end of the joust just to keep it more realistic. Kind of wish gems were easier to earn especially when they toss way higher ranked enemies at you quickly. Energy replenishes fairly quickly. Gold is fairly simple to earn. Just need to make some events for extra gems and it would be a solid 5* game. As stands it seems a little too pay to win friendly.', ""The network connection in the game is horrible. It cost me a great deal of currency which I was planning on using to upgrade my equipment. I was trying to play the echelon event, I had already registered the amount of currency needed but the game couldn't respond. It was after 5 mins when the event was over b4 it could regain connection again. It's frustrating."", 'Game could be incredible. I understand the devs have to make a living but plastering ads all over the place ruins this gorgeous and fun game. I would gladly have dropped 30 bucks to have a complete version without pay mechanics. Unfortunately another game getting uninstalled because of the way they choose to try to make money.', ""This game is very fun however I can't move to the new league despite clearing every stage in the old one. It seems a lot of people are having this issue and it's been around for some time. Pretty poor customer service in that regards as there should already have been a new update to fix that. If you take over a game make sure you keep an eye on it and fix it when it break."", ""Very Disappointed. Full of bugs and constant crashes. No response from developers even after losing hundreds of diamonds in the championship contests due to the constant crashes. I've lost so much gold too as it costs 1,500 coins to enter the championship. I've reached the league of the Dragon which is the final part of the game and now it's unplayable due to the above issues. As said, no response from developers after 20 odd complaints made. Don't waste your time. Total rubbish."", ""It was fun and great! But I only played it once, because I can't get into the game the second time. The loading screen takes 2 hours (or maybe more). My connection is stable and good just like when I played the game. Please fix this."", 'Fun game, nice graphics and animations. only downside is the cost for gem armour and the extremely slow way of earning it. The horse jumping mini game is quite tricky as the speed indicator dissappears and takes a second to reappear after the jumps meaning that you could miss a perfect run. Overall though it is a great timewaster ð', ""Even though I started playing pretty late, this game is extremely addicting. Other than not being able to play in all 3 tournaments, except for the echelon I really can't complain but I would like to see a way to stack gold other than playing training missions over and over"", ""It's an enjoyable game though it is a little repeative. I think I made it up to the third or fourth league before the game suddenly stopped working for me. Considering that it hasn't been updated since April of 2021, I think I may have played my last joust. A pity since I would have liked to have seen how the story ends."", ""I can't get into tournaments or invite friends to play. I have social seals it won't let me use. I have a Samsung Galaxy but I don't see why that should affect playing this game. Newer phone. I enjoy playing the battles so I hope customer support sees this message and helps fix the issues before I uninstall it."", ""Great game, you have to wait a bit too long to regain royal seals however, it's overall solid and entretaining. I do have one problem with it though. It Won't let me play in the championships or the friend challenges and will only allow me to enter enchellon championships. Please fix this for me. And it will be a five star rating"", ""An awesome game in overall but if the developers add one or two options of generating coins rather than jus participating in training matches it would be very good. Secondly an option to know the stats of the opponent before entering the match so that we can quit if we want and don't have to lose it for no reason Thanks for developing such a game"", ""I played this game a few years ago and recently i returned to it. Unfortunately the game seems to have stopped receiving support from the devs. The last update on the game was in 2018 and the game at the moment is filled with tiny bugs that ruin your fun (certain bonuses paid with premium currency don't work, trying to add a friend as an ally is impossible and an entire side activity where you battle other people has become unavailable). It's such a shame because the game is so unique."", ""Overall it's a really good game the controls are fairly smooth and the graphics are decent but the in-app purchases are absurdly expensive because the only way you're going to get far in this game is to spend over $100 and that is ridiculousfor a mobile game. but other than the absurdly expensive in-app purchases the game is actually very fun. It is for sure worth it download."", ""On one hand, some of the best graphics I've seen in an Android game. On the other hand, lies about needing access to my contacts to use Google Play Games and asks every time I start the game when I won't give it. Seems to be highly P2W, despite constant ads."", ""I am in LOVE with this game. The horses gaits, strides, and movements are more realistic than most games with horses out there so there's an automatic five stars from me. Currency isn't too hard to get yet not too easy. Only giving it 4 stars because I have not made it too far into the game yet. Keep up the good work, I love it!"", ""I just downloaded this game,played for a while(liked it) , exit the game...now after a while I'm trying to enter again but it automatically exits from the loading screen. Tryed many times but still not letting me play."", ""I've been playing this game for a few years now. Since it came out actually and I love the game but these adds are starting to make me not like it as much. I don't mind that adds that play but the ones that sit at the bottom need to go or something. They block me from being able to click the buttons as they block them and I also can't see the time I have left in tournaments because of them. I also can't play multiplayer anymore what is up with that same as champions"", ""Just wish there was a better story line and more events. Like sword fighting or trying to win over the maiden. Good game but a total RIP off of knights tale the movie. My favorite movie you have so much more you could do with this game that is why I gave 4 stars instead of 5. But why can't you fight in champion ship jousting. It is a fun and entertaining game and you don't have to blow money to win"", ""I rly love the game, but I have a problem with championship and frienlyes, i can't click on those two. But the game so far got me addicted. I love that they don't have so many adds and other annoying things, so I guess that this is the main reason that they don't get to mannage the bugs so quickly. Game is great guys. I love swiching gears on the horseð¤£ð¤£ð¤£(csr2)"", 'Just recently opened the app, and i was forced to download an update, and now, the game is unplayable, it crashes and force closes at the title screen. Help?!', ""I remember when this game first came out in 2014, I played it a lot and the community was awesome. FF to today, only one PVP mode left and it's populated by bots. Not a single update in a long time. Awesome, fun game. Just slowly dying. Makes me sad UPDATE Game no longer even works"", 'Amazing Epic Game!!! The controls are smooth, graphics are really nice, art style is clean and vibrant! All sorts of upgrades available for you and your mount. Really fun and challenging as well. If you like the medieval era then you will get a real kick out of this app. Jump in, win some events grab some loot and come back tomorrow for more fun! Enjoy', ""The game is great, the only real problem that i have with it is the multiple times when i would've had a perfect hit, i would lose and the game would say that i missed the target. if this is fixed then the game would get 5 stars sense everything else is very good."", 'I really like the game and how its played but the multiplayer tournaments wont work anymore. I contacted customer service and that was a joke. You WILL have to spend money eventually, especially when you get in the last two levels of tournaments during the normal gameplay. Graphics are great and the game is fun.']"
