Also the steering is shaky on my phone, I've never had problems with any other games."", ""A good game indeed you won't be bored with it love it!!!!but no car will come from behind you when you are on zero speed!!!but it's cool I wanna see different places landscapes ,,uphill ,slopes, turns and junctions and living things as well as going through cities ,jungles and village's of africa!!!

It doesn't have so many ads. I gave it five stars because, like this games are really hard to get not only that reason but there are lots of reasons why I gave five stars. The reasons are: There are not so many bad things. There are not so many buying things just some cars and sceneries. And the other thing is that when we drive it is so smooth.

I play many driving games I am seriously want that type of games where car's interior looks real.This game have nothing but I love the car interior. You have to give camera option, like 360 degree and also give steering wheel control option than this will be worth for YT gaming. And this is my humble request please improve your game asap. Or if you have any other car game so tell me."", ""Great game, my problem is... The roads arent realistic (just streight ahead no fun , this is what i must suggest to you!

Great graphics and screenplay functions. Cars should be easier to receive for use. Otherwise, great game overall!', 'Can you please add a ""distance covered"" feature?

When I feel down I just play it and feel in control. I feel I can crash multiple times and still be able to continue... Something I\'m scared of doing in real life, at the moment. So, thank you for giving me some control.', 'Nice driving game, simple and fun to play but totally ruined by intrusive ads. I understand the FTP model and usually have no probs with ads, but these just suddenly jump out at you and so often you spend more time watching ads than actually playing.', 'Great game to kill time with! The graphics are top-notch! Although however, the controls could use some work, or at least make it configurable. Other than that, great!', ""I like this game but I hope you could add more features like distance covered, city or town you're driving at and maybe a race challenge or beating a time to make the game more challenging."", 'Add steering options and let the camera be able to return in and out. Is good game but without those feautures the game is not very interesting.', 'Cool game I realy like it the graphics are nice but buying the second last car and place .When I try it fails to buy them please fix the game and add more cars.

No longer can I enter a race without the game crashing. Thanks for the 600 gold though...

Still unhappy with the performance.', 'I love it. Only thing I can say for improvement would be if this game had longer races or laps in our races. Also I wish you could race other players in real time. Not just ghosts of players. The upgrading system is addictive and well worth every part getting rebuilt and the custom parts for our cars, love it. I did rate this game 5 stars but for a lack in developement for different styles of races, I give 3 stars. Please enjoy!', 'Great graphics, relatively fun. But the main issue is the skill gap created by going too far too fast... You get to level walls that require you to level up to access more story, but not nearly enough rep points to get the levels needed as well as the huge PR score jumps needed to run missions.. I have like 20 car series chapters uncompleted because the last race needs my car to a point I cant get to and I cant run much else without it. And it wants you to spend so much money too at many points.', ""I haven't played in a long time. Downloaded the game and there were a lot of changes. Well the changes have made it extremely difficult for non paying players. It used to be challenging and still fun. Now progress grinds to a near halt for us non paying players. The changes have taken out the fun and have made it more stressful. And WHY do I have to keep downloading extra files EVERY time I log into the game!!! Time to find another racing game for me I think."", ""Great game but a few bugs.Fpr example, I'd you complete a special event and you have a time limit until you can do the same round again and the event closes. Then if you don't he same event to maybe retry, and the time limit for 6 hours is still there. But still, great game, AMAZING GRAPHICS, OUTSTANDING SOUND EFFECTS, and just absolutely ASTONISHING!!! MY #1 GAME!!!!!!"", ""Changing my review, this game has a lot of potential, its easy to pick up and is good in general. HOWEVER, the game is very very pay to win in some aspects. In special events its very difficult to win the cars with out the ability to play 24/7. If you have a job just give up on the special events. The last day has 16 races and tickets take an hour each to refresh do it takes 16 total hours. I'd rate higher if there wasn't a payroll. But know EA, thats not going to ever change. Good wallet killer"", ""Fun at first. Ah but theres a catch. Once you advance to a certain point and get too good, the game algorithm takes over and cheats. Tries to get you to spend real money to upgrade your car by playing on your emotions and ego. PVP races are not against an actual live player on the other end. The algorithm runs one of someone else's previous races against you and always throws in a ringer so it wins. All it wants is to extort your money thru frustration. GFY!!! Have a nice day! Rant off!"", ""Obviously superb car graphics, but also some great track designs and interesting multiple courses per environment (includes day/night and rain). Some cars you unfortunately can't customize with different paint/parts. There are forced ads, but they only happen once or twice after a dozen or so races so it's not terrible."", ""High quality but honestly a little boring. One thing this game does better than other games is it forces manual steering. BUT you can't turn on manual acceleration or brakes. Your car always drives at the perfect speed. Edit: Removed criticism about monetization, as I just remembered a certain other racing game I enjoyed has no less loot boxes."", ""Great game was having a ton of fun with it but once I got to chapter 15 race nine I can't beat it, and my car is almost 100 more pr than the opponents, somehow he is still way faster than my car which is ridiculous.ive probably wasted a hundred fuel on it and can't make any progress.ive never gotten stuck like this in this game, I'm sure the race is broken because I've read several boards talking about that race specifically. Please fix soon"", 'I would give it a better rating, but the ONLY way to win the additional races is to pay. It literally will not let you win additional items in a timely manner preventing you from ever winning all the blueprints for special events cars. And many times I have crossed the finish line with nano seconds to spare and it claims I have failed. It also will ""Cheat"" by having vehicles nitro blast at the last second that are way underpowered to your car. Fix the obvious cheats and I\'ll change my review.', 'READ BEFORE YOU DOWNLOAD. FIRST! The cars you see on the ads/videos, YOU MUST BUY basically. It\'s a fun game yeah, but it costs entirely too much just to progress in it now.. You can only play for so long before you have to modify your car even more, which you\'ll end up needing the BPs to do...So getting the Blueprints now is a mission in itself! gets annoying. It\'s become more of a ""Pay To Play"" version of the game, which sucks for the kid in us all. Cool for a little, not worth it money wise', ""The roll system to gain parts and blueprints is the worst thing in the history of gaming. You end up never getting the part you're trying for and are just wasting time running the same courses over and over while the roll system hoses you repeatedly with items you don't want or need. That's what a typical session of Need for Speed gaming is. Giant waste of time doing the same thing over and over while getting nothing or nowhere. They need to do away with the roll system for this to be playable."", ""Frustrated with the upgrading. All through the last two stages of parts I have put onto my golf it hasn't increased in stats at all. Then, I really don't like the way I'm forced to upgrade and race several different cars than the ones I want just to make progress. Upgrading is TOO expensive and tedious to be made to waste my time and effort playing a game not the way I want to play it. What a waste. Two stars cause I like how to drive in the game, and it looks good."", ""Was looking for a game that was pretty involved, and this definitely does the trick. There are so many activities and different categories of cars. The modifications are pretty extensive too. I'd probably give it 4.5 stars if possible, just because I've definitely spent a decent chunk of change so far mainly because the game has a lots of sales to purchase stuff like in game credits and gold, used to further your modifications and such."", ""I downloaded this game on a whim. I've tried a few racing games and they all suck compared to consoles. Except for this game. I am wholly addicted to this game. It has the best controls compared to others trying to use virtual buttons. The touch left and right to turn with slide down the middle for handbrake drifting and slide up to activate turbo are perfect. I gave 4 stars due to night levels being a little difficult to see for me because there is little color difference between track and not"", ""Terrible controls. Make the virtual steering static. The system for drifting and nitro is awful. Why is it nearly impossible to transfer a drift from one direction to another? Forcing players to drag up and down for drift and nitro instead of pushing a single button to initiate is the worst design choice I've ever seen. Graphics are fine but there's no way to get over the controls"", 'Good game. Good graphics. Very addictive if you are a NFS fan. BUT.. This is by no means a free game. Special events are practically impossible to finish without paying real $$$, and trust me, you will end up paying a lot.I agree that makers need to make some money from the games, but this is another level. DO NOT DOWNLOAD if you are not willing to spend real $$$$. I played for a while and paid a lot, but there is a limit to this. No longer playing this. This is insane.', ""Honestly I was really surprised by this one. First off love the controls. The game looks good and feels good. Has a really good soundtrack that suits a racing game. Lots of cars are premium currency but it seems like you can earn premium currency with just a bit of time and effort, lots better than some other games I've reviewed lately lol. All and all so far a good solid racing game easy on the eyes and responsive controls...also easy on the wallet lol."", ""My favorite racing/drifting game there is out there. I only wish is wasn't so hard to get new cars and be able to unlock upgrades for them. Also need more variety of parts like wheels spoilers and body kits. Oh and could you PLEASE make the neon lights easily available? I don't think they need to be locked in the first place!"", ""doesn't really feel like I need for speed game. you race for 20 seconds on an on rails track. you see a red transparent thing ahead, cross it the race is over then you click on some cards again. I started to dread seeing the red finish line thing. held out for about 10 more of these short races to become proper races with laps, and then uninstalled."", ""Kind of amusing, sometimes. Extremely low odds of beating most of the special events without using gold. Definitely accidentally made a purchase for 10 gas because of an annoying pop up, so that sucks. I'm willing to accept some fault but also want to point out they have like 37 pop ups when you play sometimes and if you're not careful they will literally make it as easy as possible to take money out of your pocket for something that doesn't really add value."", ""I get it, games are made to make money from customers. Otherwise what's the point, business is business.  At first game was pretty cool to play. Threw some cash here and there. I've lost my patience with game. I didn't have a problem spending cash. But come on man! You gotta to give a little to get a little. Odds of winning parts not in customers favor, game feels to RIGGED. To keep racing the same courses over and over with little odds  of getting parts is insanity. I'm so done, too bad"", ""Cons: Auto save is very unreliable, you will lose progress sometimes. No controller support (still in 2022?)(really?). Lack of options, like graphics or adjusting volumes; just music and sound effects on/off. Not much music, repetitive soundtrack.

Good multi-player system. Ongoing development."", ""Love the game. Only thing you should work on well two things lol. If you end up needing to redownload the game again the tutorial prevents you from signing into Google Play Games. Also the special events take too much to complete without money.

Plus I'm sure that player would come back and spend some money"", ""0 stars, game is absolutely trash! Spent money.. still trash.

Then finally won a decent reward and it disappeared......"", ""What a game this was. Sadly this game like others say when you are new it's fun but once you have it for a while it becomes hard to unlock the cars & other stuff. It's mostly a pay to win game unfortunately. I have spent ZERO in this game. And this game is so cheap that we haven't received a free car, NEVER. We used to sometimes get lots of free gold not anymore. Still have it cuz of some cars I couldn't unlock in other racing games as well as spent a lot of time customizing my cars."", 'Its a great game except you should be given more tickets. You can tell there desperate for money. They give you just enough tickets that you run out before the alloted time and have to buy more or lose your progress in some cases.

Races are short (~60 seconds) but satisfying. Cons: very grindy after ~40Ÿ™ game is completed. I have not felt incentive to buy gold, as it doesn't advance you much. Auto-steering physics and track arrows pointing the wrong way cause unfair crashes. Some races promise rewards that are not awarded at race end. Arbitrarily high vehicle requirements halt progress. Special events require tons of gold to finish."", ""I love playing it but I have a couples things I dislike about it and it's the having to wait to fill up the tank to get to 10 a lot if your constantly playing. The having to watch ads to keep playing. Having to watch more ads to get gold to buy gas if you Run out. And if you play it quite a bit it tends to happen a lot which is pretty annoying. But if didn't have to watch a million ads to get more gas/money to be able to play I'd probably give this a 5 star review."", ""The worst thing about this game is is hitting a roadblock in the campaign. It takes so long to get through it, I just stopped playing the game. The fact that you NEED money to win or you don't get a fair chance of winning means that EA hasn't changed their ways that much. But if they were to fix that and add a multiplayer open world, I'd rate 5 stars in a heartbeat."", ""Great game, awesome cars, sounds and graphics!

After watching youtube videos on strategy I spent over $60 USD to try to follow the plan to success and my beginning cars are not even halfway to their full potential of upgrades and lightyears behind anyone I get paired with on anything multiplayer.

You upgrade your vehicle and it still barley climbs hills, but if you barley hit the back button he launches backwards like a rocket, so you'll hit forward then he goes zipping forward like nothing does a flip and it's over, but can't climb a hill. Can do a flip because it's got so much power it can't stay on the ground, but when you get control of the vehicle it can't climb a hill. Seems like the game sets you up for failure.

Other than that, this is one of THE games I go to when I want to pass some time. Its fun, there's many maps to play on, many cars, and for some reason a spider mech that caught my eye.

If you are looking for a taste of how 2012-2014 mobile games were like, this is the game. It's simple, easy to play, and something that you don't find in many new games. The courses are great, the vehicles are amazing, and you don't get the cartoony garbage of the new mobile game era. My only issue with it is the ads. Granted, no game can be completely free but this game is notorious for having no advertisements. Overall, amazing title. Give it a play, no regret guarantee!"", ""Played this game over 7 years ago, loved it, opened all the maps, unlocked all the cars, etc. Had to uninstall it a few months ago, but made sure I saved it to the cloud.

It would be nice if a player could upgrade a little easier when first starting.

However the ads have gone up a bit, they're fairly used and not packed, and I get the ad rev. But that's probably me complaining about ads, when it's not a problem at all, lol."", ""The only thing I would change is how the game saves.I got a new phone and all my data erased.

Don't waste coins anything besides the Super Off-road Vehicle, it's all you need.

The controlls are very intuitive and easy to learn. Some people are saying ""the game is crashing"" or ""it wont download"" those are just problems with their device.

Thank you for the fantastic game, and oh yeah. One more thing, the grind! Anything above 1 million coins, is too much.

Fun and challenging- I just CANNOT get past 1,225m on the Moon level! I've tried for years! XD Best level for making quick coin, tho.

There's a lot of different cars, and maps to unlock, and they'll keep you busy for a while.

When I first played this game afew years back. Apart from some of the new vehicles they put in. I basically upgraded all my vehicles and unlocked all the maps that way available at the time. But when you get a new phone. You can't save your progress. Which means you gotta start all over again and to be honest. It is boring especially when you've already done it all before. So I might delete and not come back."", 'The game after 1.54 has been utterly destroyed, the game crashes often, nearly gurenteed after opening toolboxes, or any other loot box, when claiming coins from the pool of parts, the game crashes. or when you press too many buttons, the game freezes.', ""Since it won't let me give 0 stars.

Just one thing i dont like is that if you run out of fuel, it ends the run after about 4 seconds, unlike the HCR 2 where the run ends when you stop moving. This can get annoying if you're so close to the fuel, and then you get slapped in the face with the results of your run.

Multiplayer is a cool idea but it is either very glitchy or racing people in other countries causes lagging. You can hit someone and they keep driving like nothing happened.

As of now, I've had it with this game. Uninstalling!"", ""In my opinion this is the only car racing game that should be in existence.

There have been some bugs but I've never seen developers resolve the issue so fast as I have with this game. If I could ask for one addition it would be customization for the cars to include more choice of paint and effects such as iridescent paint and choice of rims such as Cragar SS. Otherwise....unmatched. MC"", ""It has awesome controller support. The game works great on my Razer Kishi. It's clear a foreign language port so some of the English is amazing. The downfall, and a major one, is the multiplayer. It uses ghosts that are racing the same track but with different traffic conditions.

Real easy to begin but after you get to level 5 - 6 it's almost impossible to win races without spending money. I don't want or expect it to be super easy all the way through but when I use all my fuel to beat 1 opponent, running a clean race, it get frustrating. I really enjoy it's not a straight race, more than just straight line shifting."", 'The game play is pretty good, the touch controls are ok once you get them dialed in for yourself, the tilt control can be a little too sensitive and I have adjusted the sensitivity. Overall a great racing game, devs, work on the sensitivity issues and this game is awesome! Also, maybe an option for easy drive in story mode, but for less rewards. Something to think about.', ""I really liked this game at first. The races are cool and the online was cool. I haven't felt forced to pay anything at all for this game. But now it seems as if their servers are messed up. Always having problems getting to the multiplayer area. And this game constantly freezes during their very many ads that they force on you. I understand that games take money to develop and maintain. That's not my issue. The constant game freezing and multiplayer issues are becoming very annoying."", 'Fun game, nice and easy controls. One thing I do not like very much is when you hit your boost for your vehicle. The other cars are automatically staying the same distance from when you start your boost. it would be nice if it reacted like a true boost and was able to create a separation or true distance from other vehicles you racing when using your boost.', ""Very good graphics, it's fun during story mode, you don't have to spend to enjoy story mode, just a little grinding and patience, the main problem is multiplayer, they pit you against cars that are in a higher bracket than you, it's almost impossible to finish 1st, unless you have the top of the line car, I wish they would just keep the races even by class."", 'Fun game and a great time passer. No real need to spend $ if patient. Graphics are nice and controls are easily mastered with some practice. Fun challenges and campaign. A cool feaure to add would be the ability to sell previously owned vehicles at 3/4 to 1/2 the price along with some extra credits for the upgrades purchased. Also I feel that playing chicken with oncoming traffic should earn a few more risk points than in the proper lane. But over all a great game.', ""Nice cars and great graphics. Decent storyline. The multiplayer PvP races could use improvement as we should have players with pretty evenly matched cars racing on the same race track so that could be improved though. Another issue is that it's confusing to get upgraded cars which you need to continue playing, so you kinda hit a wall a week in or so. Also, the bonus points for risky driving (passing next to other cars and almost hitting them) seems pretty irresponsible."", 'I love this game. Controls are easy and adjustable. Really like the ""easy drive"" and the updated past races make the grind for money easier. Adds aren\'t to many and usually short.

I have been playing for weeks and I cant stop."", ""There's a bonus for not crashing. I am not getting this bonus most of the time. At first I thought I was lighty grazing other vehicles, but there is a race type that you instantly fail if you crash.

Some require you to drive a hot rod. The hot rod randomly flips over."", ""A lot of fun and, later on, it gets pretty challenging. But... the game forces you to change to a better car the further you go. Cars are too expensive and upgrades don't do much... You'll spend thousands on upgrades and your car will barely be any faster. Sorry... adding a turbo kit, cams, and hi-comp pistons should add a lot more than just 5 horsepower.

It is a shame that more of the game can be enjoyed by those who don't normally rely on cash to further their progress in the game. Enhancements to vehicles beyond simple upgrades need to better explained. It appears that you can merge 2 cars together which are dissimilar and no details are provided regarding the outcome. Trucks are unusable unless you pay real money and most exclusive events and cars also require this."", ""A fun game but definitely a pay to advance game. You get so far and you can't advance any farther until you pay REAL MONEY. Also, I've noticed, when I race in tracks and laps, all the cars take curves great but there are 2 curves, so far, that my car acts like it just will not steer. It's fun but not enough for me to recommend it to anyone. It seems the problems are the same with most of the players. Why not fix the problem?"", ""FUN. But PAY-to-PLAY if you want to unlock everything and be top-tier. I used to play every day, maxing out my gas cans. Now I'm a very casual participant. Enjoyable. I like the simplicity - only steering (no gas/brake) and the races are short. that said, it does limit the skill involved so races against real opponents are largely based on how good is the car. Developers - add a speedometer so you can get better feedback on different racing lines. The campaigns are much fun and I like building up a car collection as well as customizing their looks. ORIGINAL races are great, but need more tracks. ITALY (Mini Cooper) venues are fun. TRUCKS are ok. LAPS are terrible and annoying - sometimes you skid, sometimes you don't. Must pay lots of money for new cars and upgrades. This game used to reward consistent play. Now it rewards CASH. They've been adding alot of new cars. Most, you either have to buy outright ($9.99) or take a chance for low odds on a gold crate, which can be even more expensive. You can earn keys to open the crates, but it takes several months, in which time several new cars have been introduced. The competitions are fun (H2H or campaigns), but the gold requirements are hefty for free-to-play, and the prizes have gotten really pitiful. Instead of getting the necessary parts or augments, now you get keys to separate boxes."", ""The game is good and addictive, but not Free to Play. You can only get as far close to the top, but then your car is stopped if you don't pay. Everytging is carefully orchestrated to let you advance enough to feel you are close to complete a level, but never win if you don't pay. Interactive competitions same things, no real competition unless you can afford to pay the increases. Best option, play for a while and then leave the game. But good effort Hutch - you could do better and make more cash"", 'I really love the game, but it does get frustrating sometimes. Parts are nearly impossible to find so you end up spending gold to get the parts. When you run out of gold, so far it seems like the only way to get it is to buy it.

Just a few gripes: Sometimes your car gets 'stuck' to an AI car during a race and there is nothing you can do to prevent being run into a wall. Also, at times there are not any interesting races to run, since the tracks are so short and so limited in variety.

I read several reviews saying that it was around here that people began to have a difficult time. I\'d disagree. Yes, my opponents are better but my car is also stronger and faster and I feel like I\'m winning more races. One complaint I had with BB1 is that, after a certain point, I would always win races. That certainly hasn\'t been the case with v2. I\'ve got to work to win, which keeps it fun for me. One new feature I like is the ability to select which weapons I want to use. Yes, there are a TON - including some cool new ones - but you have 8 slots so you have to put some thought and strategy behind it. A few complaints/areas-to-improve: I\'ll agree with the sentiment that ""Challenge"" races are often difficult. I\'ve picked several team members, so no complaints there but I\'ve only managed to pick up 1 additional car. I also miss the Circuit/Cup Races and the individual track races. Now it\'s just 2 random tracks. If there is a track I like or one I\'d like to get better at, I have to wait or cycle through. I docked 1 star for this . ***UPDATED SPRING 2021*** I originally gave the game 4 stars based on play for the first few levels. I\'ve now topped out at the levels. I still play but weapon power-ups are VERY expensive at this stage - 100k coins. If you run a few races per day and compete in the weekly challenges, it will take you 2-3 months to build up 100k coins. That is entirely too much racing. To buy the coins, it would cost you around $10 per power-up. That is an egregious ask. Play daily for a year to get 4-6 power ups. Whoever thought that was a good idea is a stupid, stupid person. This element of the game needs to be improved. I docked 2 stars for that. It is also pretty rare that I lose a race. The AI is lazy at this point. A few EASY changes would make this a 5-star game. ***UPDATE FOR EARLY 2022*** I\'m sticking with my rating of 2 stars. Some moron decided you should make the weapons - the ones we worked hard to upgrade - less effective and not last as long. Additionally, they changed the way you collect weapons and now you can\'t get a new one while using one that has a time limit. This diminishes the usefulness of weapons, which makes them less valuable. It also trashes all the time put in to upgrade the weapons. So why am I not at 1 star? They did improve the coin accumulation so it no longer takes 60+ days to get enough for a powerup. So good job there. But $10 for a single powerup is still highway robbery. One step forward, two steps back.', 'I used to have 3 stars for this game, but after not playing it for a while, I came back to see what changed. First, they did add some really cool new levels and game design! But they also changed the game to be much more ad heavy, they made the new cars be prohibitively expensive, they moved the spawn points really far back if you get hit, and lastly they changed the reward at high levels to be just 29 gold for 1st place. One upgrade costs minimum 9000 gold so it takes 311 races to upgrade once!', 'This Hot Wheels event feels rigged. The first chance to get a new car flew by way too soon, and if I\'m one of the first to play these stupid events, I shouldn\'t come in 9th place! The same goes for the ""limited addition"" cars.

That would save a lot of time and lower some frustration.', ""Another update and powerups are still limited for the worse. On top of that, they've taken away a bunch of the original race tracks.

Issue 1 is that every track feels like a super-speedway; no braking required. Issue 2 is that it is so hard to get rewards. Like the first modern car costs 25,000, but at first, you can only get 1,000 at a time. Yet the lowest in game amount cash is 50,000 for $2.99. Basically, it's a pay to win game, or at least have some fun."", 'The game itself has nice graphics and good controls. However it is ""everyone gets a trophy"" meaning in the multiplayer mode anyone you beat by less than 1 second also gets a win. I have exchanged screenshots with other players to verify it. Even if 5 cars are within a second of the leader all get wins on their screens. There is no way to see who is really winning. I Emailed support twice to see if they would address the issue but got no reply. Can no longer recommend this game.', ""This game is so close to perfect, but there's one major problem: The way cars slam into each other. I can barely tap one car and next thing I know I'm swerving out of control and lose my lead in a matter of seconds. Sometimes I can even be the one hitting them super hard and the se thing happenes only this time I get T-boned. If you could fix this, that would be so great.

Then I ALWAYS have to start in last and I never make my way up to the position I need to be in. Or they would be stupid enough to knock me in the pits. Fox this problem and a five star rating is in line"", ""This is a great game, but can be improved. The graphics are great, has good performance, has good libraries of cars, the competition is good, but more tracks could be added. And, another improvement I could suggest I'd make if I was a beta tester, is Demolition Derby, a game mode that involves crashing cars, and the one who survives everything wins (blah, blah...), and fix a bug in which you reverse at the start of practice and can't control it, but otherwise, great game, but not perfect!

It shows nothing different. 2nd its hard to get money to upgrade your car.

I would recommend this game"", ""Pretty good game. There's just 2 problems that make this game bad. 1 the race starts when the race is still loading and 90% of the time you get hit from behind and spun around. 2 when your on single player there's always 2 sometimes 1 cars that go like 200 mph when your going 120. The only way you can win those is if you luck out and they spin out. It makes me think its rigged against you because I play multiplayer and win almost every time. Fix those things and it would be a awesome game."", 'There are a few fixes and this game can be great. If the AI used the pits, if all cars were cunstomizable, if the start was fair like letting all cars start at once, if the AI wasnt as prone to crash, if there were more tracks and race options like dirt tracks or 100, or 200 laps. These options would make the game great. Nonetheless it is still the best racing game ive found by far.', ""This is a good game. I have raced cars for years. The only issue I have is the competition doesn't race you. All they do is try to wreck you. This isn't a racing game it's a crashing game. I have raced for real for many years. If they would correct that one issue this would be a really awsome game. In real racing you do not try to wreck your opponent. You try to out drive them."", ""This game has potential to become something very special, it merely requires better execution and bug fixes. Even with all it's problems and the fact that Martinsville is literally impossible to win in championship it is still the best Nascar game on the market right now. Tweak the difficulty, put in more racers and more racer variations, and maybe fix the points and wins system. This game can truly become special if my advice is heeded."", ""It's a good enough game that still needs improving.

Would like to see qualifying rounds for starting position. The endurance races are a little ridiculous, 400 laps can take 3 hours and you\'ve lapped 2nd place 5 times by lap 20.

Anyhoo, probaly will uninstall.', 'The game was great before this last update. I do like the more aggressive AI and the new rough racing. there are a lot of bugs to fix tho. In one race I did, the AI was only moving about 25 mph. in another they blew right by me. They can also fix the aggressiveness of the AI.

One, I wish you could turn the volume off because I like to listen to music while I play games on my phone.

This would be pretty convenient. Also, there aren't much gems in the game. That's it"", 'The controls need fine tuning, the drifting mechanism is detestable, and the gravity is wonky (the gravitational constant and the centers of mass on the vehicles are incorrect).

Kind of disappointed. But other then that, the best car simulator I have ever played.', 'Its a really good game. The graphics are beautiful, there are lots of good cars, there are alot of events and there are three control settings. The mape has lots of good sections too.

There is no option for tilt controls, so rotating your vehicle using your device is also out. Overall, a pretty solid game other than the lack of control options. With a bit more work, it could be really fun! Nice job, devs!üëç"", 'Easy to learn, challenging to master.
