Feels clunky and unstable at times. Aspects to the glitchy video player that could be more intuitively designed. The title of the current section and video should be front and center as you are watching. It's frustrating having to scroll down through the entire list of sections for that course to find the title of the current video playing. Needs a better user interface"", ""I have many courses on my account (that I've paid for) and I have been using udemy for years. Suddenly in the middle of watching a lecture, the app decided the it won't cast anymore. I've tried to cast to 3 different chromecast devices (that were manufacured by google) and had the same issue, rebooted the phone, cleared memory, and re-installed the app, still the same issue remains. Many people on forums complaining about this, and I've contacted Udemy support - they are doing nothing"", ""I sincerely enjoy Udemy because of the great courses, but after having it for a few years I don't understand why there isn't a dedicated TV app. Chromecast is unstable with Udemy specifically. I can hardly get it to work. It often skips or returns to previous videos. Part of the enjoyment is watching courses on a big screen like you're in a classroom. If they actually manage to change these issues, I will proudly rate the app 5 stars."", ""I love this app for watching and keeping track of my courses BUT the reason i won't give the app 5 stars is because for whatever reason the courses individual lessons get disorganized. I'd understand if it was a one off issue but it's come up multiple times across multiple courses. Ex. Individual Lessons are numbered My current course shows them in this order Section 1 1, 2, 3, 6, 4, 7, 5, 8 The sad part is even tho they're separated by lessons numbers 6, 7, 8 are part of Section 2 originally"", 'Feb. 24 - after the update, can no longer access all of my courses through the app. When I click ""load more"" in my learning, nothing happens even though I\'ve purchased upwards of 50 courses. Only about 10 or so are accessible. 30/12 update - can no longer download course resources within the app 19/12 QA are easy to navigate. Course videos are good quality, ability to take notes and download lectures, as well as adjust playback speed.', ""Beyond frustrated with this app, I don't think anyone working on it actually uses it. All of the ways I try to watch, like on a plane via offline downloads or in my living room via Chromecast while eating, either barely work or not at all. Laughably, on a plane, I have to disconnect from the onboard network to get it to play files *locally* on my device. Streaming to Chromecast either doesn't work at all, or it breaks in frustrating ways like playing the same video over and over. I give up."", ""The Udemy app continuously stops on its own or crashes on both android & ios. I have tried using it on chrome browser, 3 different Android phones, an Android tablet, and 1 iphone and it's the same on all the devices except on the browser it keeps stopping on its own but doesn't crash. The app is even worse when trying to play the videos on a TV. When casting it from the browser it keeps stopping. I've been trying to use the app for years and I keep giving up because it's so bad."", ""The app simply does not work with Chromecast anymore, at least with Android. Just displays an error message when trying to cast. The app has been re-installed a few times and the Chromecast was rebooted, every other app I have works fine but this app will not. It's a shame as casting to a TV is a great way to study"", 'What did this app do? I see it shows my user info, but otherwise it just has a little ""loading"" spinner in the better of the screen. No indication of what it\'s doing, when it will finish, etc. None of my courses are listed. Useless Update: I guess all you have to do is give it a bad review and it will decide to work now. Not giving it any more stars though.', ""I've been a user for several years. I love the service: courses are many and inexpensive. The app, however, is a piece of trash not fit to install. It is unresponsive, slow, unwilling to play videos I have downloaded to my phone, and unwilling to save files to the SD card, despite the fact the app allegedly has that ability. I don't know what the people at Udemy are doing but it surely isn't fixing this dumpster fire. They should take a few of their programming courses and fix the app."", ""I like how you can download lectures or whole courses easily to either the SD card or internal memory. Changing the play speed is a great feature - I use it all the time. As my number of courses increases, it's getting harder to manage them. There's simply no way to organize or group courses effectively. This is getting so frustrating, I'm having to drop a star. Also, the app has difficulty playing consistently when my screen turns off or I move between apps."", ""Udemy is an excellent service and company that I am very grateful for (5/5). However, the app itself is insanely buggy. It's trash. Simply getting to the list of lessons in the course requires me to go back to the home screen and select the course all over again, which just ends up bringing up the video that's already playing. Then my video player will get locked in full screen mode. I literally have to close the app and reopen JUST to select a different video in the SAME course. So stupid."", ""This app I a HUGE disappointment. It has very limited settings. Videos automatically when you click on a course and you can't turn it off. It gives you the option to use an SD card, tells you it saving to it, but when you check the SD card in settings, it's all saved to internal storage, and then refuses to save to the SD card once it has eaten up all your internal storage. They also don't have in-app assistance or issue reporting. The website they want you to use is primitive a pain to use."", ""I like the course, but the app is probably the worst thing I've ever used on a phone. Want to download videos or the whole course? no problem you can do that, but you certainly can not play those downloaded videos if you have little or no internet connection. try uninstalling, reinstalling, airplane mode, jump through hoops and stop being able to get texts, because these guys are terrified of piracy and can't come up with a secure way to deal with it. streaming sites pull if off, but not udemy"", 'Courses are ok. There are two thing I dont like though. Casting the video lectures to Chromecast always results in the very first video of the whole course being played. To know how long a particular section is going to take to finish, you have to manually add the time taken by all the videos in that section. Why not show the time each section takes in total? This has been a pain everytime I sit to plan my studies and come up with a timeline to finish the course.', 'Can\'t download your course? You can fix the ""trying to download, crashes app"" in v7.20.1 (this is current info as of 1/31/22) by downloading each course lesson individually. Yes, it\'s a pain to do. But at least you can have the courses offline. The 3* is reflective of the fact to remedy this issue I had to comb through the support comments. The app, content, and overall user experience (minus this incredibly annoying bug) has been great, otherwise.', 'Suggested improvements for the app 1. While playing on 2x speed, audio on videos produces weird noises. I tested this on the website as well. Only downloaded videos do not have this problem 2. When switching to full screen mode, video should be able to rotate to the orientation which the user has held his phone. Sometimes the video shows up upside down', ""Despite downloading the videos, it still uses the data when viewing it. I have to physically turn off my data service in order to use the downloaded video. Also, it always automatically plays a video after clicking on a course. It doesn't not give me the option to pause it immediately, only after the video loads and waste a few seconds of playtime. Lastly, the video continues playing in the background, despite closing the application and going to another app. I would hope the video pauses."", ""More concerned with anti-piracy measures than facilitating learning. Can't screenshot slides from videos (changes to a black screen), closes when you switch to a note taking app, plays the wrong video when you return, downloads break more often than not (4 of the last 36 attempts worked), and overall unresponsive. A video that I downloaded that worked yesterday no longer works today. It's a mess. But hey, at least I can't steal the content I'm paying for."", ""Great content, garbage app. Constant connection and sign-in problems! Can log in on phone, but not tablet (credentials are saved to password manager on both devices, wont work with/without vpn). Can't log in with a VPN on any device, 2 different VPNs tried. Udemy, I love your content, but this app is trash. I've contacted support, no response or they can't fix it. Pluralsight is looking better and better..."", ""I do like Udemy but I don't use it as much as I would like to because I'm not always able to get an internet connection. Luckily, Udemy has added the ability to install courses so I don't have to bootleg the courses I paid for. Unfortunately, this feature only works with Android/iOS and it does not save to the SD card even though there is an option for it. So, I can't install my courses onto my Chromebook as it doesn't have a lot of internal memory."", ""Casting is extremely busted, was hoping to use it for learning while running on treadmill but have tried multiple times. It keeps jumping to a previous video, no way to even skip ahead when it's casting to even work around it going to a previous lesson. Auto advance doesn't work either in casting. I have a unifi network with the access point near, new 4k Chromecast and pixel 6 so it isn't my equipment as I can cast multi other apps with zero issues. Can't get around with screen mirror either."", 'It cannot cast to Chromecast. I\'ve attempted to cast to three devices from my Pixel 6 Pro with same result. The target device displays ""Waiting for the Lecture"" but it never comes. The app displays ""There was a problem with Chromecast. Please try again"". I can cast to the same devices from YouTube, etc., the problem is not with Chromecast. Update: The support agent said paid courses cannot be cast. Claimed casting support is a myth. What\'s the point of showing cast button?', ""That it takes *forever* to load and play lectures when I have poor connectivity is a huge pain. I pre-dowloaded the lectures so that poor connectivity wouldn't be a problem but the app takes ~60 seconds to load and then ~20 seconds for a cached video to start playing is pretty embarrassing. Otherwise, I'm enjoying the course I bought!"", ""Even after several updates, this app is still garbage. Poor app experience, videos jump ahead, casting is inconsistent, controls to play, skip ahead or back don't work sometimes while casting. Inconsistency with app remembering where you left off in a course. Overall it's extremely buggy as there are too many issues to list. Casting is completely broken. App needs to be thoroughly tested and bugs worked out before releasing to users."", ""Awesome app over all. Has a few bugs that could be worked out of it. My only real problem I've had was when I have a few courses downloaded the app would crash in low service areas. If you only download 1 course at a time you should be good though. Fix that and the app would be perfect."", ""App plays videos out of order and frequently says there are issues with casting to Chromecast devices. Ran into these issues on two separate Android devices as well as two separate Chromecast devices (Vizio smartcast and Google TV device). Had to switch to use their website since the mobile app is having trouble. Guessing there is no QA or that they aren't being thorough in their testing."", ""Casting/mirroring option buggy. When I cast (option within app) what's on the screen to a device, it plays a random lesson, not what's on screen. When I use the screen mirroring option (option on my phone), it shows everything on my screen but the actual video playing. It's a just a black square but the correct lesson is playing and I can see everything else on the screen just fine. I'm using an adroid device."", ""Don't use if you plan to Chromecast. I'm watching a series of lectures and numbers 10 and 11 (so far) won't cast. The app shows #9 and then jumps to #12. When I contacted support, they said (quite rudely) that it's not avaiable for all lectures. This makes no sense. Why is the Cast icon even showing for lectures that supposedly won't work?"", ""I have used this app for a few years now and it still surprises me how many bugs there still are. The most common that I run across everytime I use it is one that will randomly start playing the next video (and it will sometimes check mark the original video you were watching for you, making it hard to tell what you've missed). Udemy itself is great, but they clearly need some new people on the app development team."", ""Developers need to look at issues that we address here. Video from the index jumps to different ones, and it didn't happen on the browser. Video is unable to cast to Google Chrome, app display error while GChrome displays waiting for the lecture. I cleared cached, uninstalled, reinstalled, and it is still happening. I need to cast the lecture to my TV because I want to watch the video while having hands-on experience. Please fix the issue. Thank you."", ""The course was $14.99, but when added it to the cart and went to check out the price was changed to $89.99. Also, all courses were about $15, I logged out and logged back in 5 mins later and all of the prices were increased by A LOT! At this point I'm not yet sure if this was a technical difficulty or company's tricky greed. 🤔"", ""Over all the courses are good and there is a fair amount of courses to pick from. Offline is non existent. If you dont have a net connection it will not play offline downloaded courses. The auto play when you open a course also SUCKS. I use two devices to view my courses. Sometimes the other device doesn't update right and it will AUTO play the wrong one. You also cant just jump into the course to view notes without it autoplaying.... which if your offline will crash the app."", ""For being an education platform, this Udemy app should be top notch and easy to navigate. The latter is true. This app has great potential to go from mediocre to awesome if you would fix little annoying things. For example you could fix the issue of the 'load more' button not functioning on the mobile phone app. I use the Galaxy Note Plus and I don't see my other courses because the app won't load them all. Please fix."", ""Edit 2: This app is not usable even on my phone anymore. I can't watch any videos, downloaded or not. I am connected to the internet and YouTube works perfectly. I can't put up with this anymore. Time to start using Coursera again. Edit: I can't see half of my courses on my tablet. Original: Video loading is extremely slow, much worse than YouTube. It's possible to download content, so that's good. But the app is a bit clunky. 3/5 overall."", ""Overall, I'm a fan of this app. I love being able to watch courses on my phone or cast them to my TV and it has many of the features that I liked with the browser version. But it still needs some work. The autoplay is random at best. Sometimes it will play several in a row and then suddenly need me to click on the lesson to load it. Other times it doesn't autoplay at all. Worst is when it decides to start an episode several minutes in and I have to go in and fix it. A decent app but not perfect."", ""The actual service udemy provides is great. It's a good way to learn new skills from insightful people, for a very affordable price. That said, the app is garbage. Yes, the videos take forever to load and don't play well, just like other reviewers have commented. But what's worse is that the app is incredibly difficult to navigate, classes are difficult to search for, and there are multiple courses which I have purchased that just don't appear at all on the mobile version."", ""A very good platform to learn new things, I passed my Comptia exams with the Total Seminar courses. I highly recommend Udemy.  My issue is with the app itself and the ads that pop up. There's nothing more annoying than a pop-up ad in the middle of a lecture of a course I paid for.    This seems to only happen on the App, I would recommend that anyone using it just download the lessons and play them in Airplane mode or just access them through a browser."", 'So far, so awesome! Just started my first course. Life coaching, no real direction in mind to use this practically, just wanted to know more about the subject. Great layout and lots of information. I\'d say it pays to do side research on the instructors prior to purchase, as I did see some ""quacks"". Be smart and think about the content before just jumping into a course.', 'Excellent interface, videos work well, and all around good e perience. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I have to jump to a PC to review course documents or to take quizzes. I understand that, depending on the topic, some content requires a PC, but I think I should be able to read notes/documents and take quizzes on my phone.']","['org.coursera.android', 'com.linkedin.android.learning', 'org.domestika', 'org.edx.mobile', 'com.skillshare.Skillshare']",https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.udemy.android&hl=en&gl=us

Most are very short and to the point. They are free unless you want/need a diploma or completion certificate. Most of the completion classes are about 1.5 hours and diploma classes start at about 10 hours. Good information if you just want to increase your knowledge of certain areas. I have taken about 20 different classes just to learn a little about everything. Also if your test questions do not load correctly, this app was designed for desktop/laptop applications not mobile.', ""Great course well laid out. Easy to learn and nice you you can take notes in the app and save and email to yourself later with the heading of the topic for easy review. It's nice also that you can retake the test multiple times if needed but not the same questions appear every time to ensure you learn.

Was able to download a course over cellular data, but then it would never play. It would play and then immediately pause. The audio only trigger in the video triggers a loading icon over the video. But doesn't actually do anything else from what I can tell. Quite often when watching videos the sound doesn't seem to line up with the people's mouth movements."", 'I mostly enjoy using the app, but there is a glaring issue. The user experience needs better functionality by creating a ""begin"" or ""start"" button for courses. There have been many times when I have merely tapped on the picture of a course to view more information, but the tap sets the course to begin. Now the course has begun, is a part of my history, and I get suggestions for more courses like it. A simple button to press when users are actually prepared to begin a course would alleviate this', ""Autoplay consistently autoplays maybe 10% of the time. The other 90% of the time, when it gets to the end of the recording and should theoretically then start to play the next in the series, it just stops and I need to manually click the play button. There's no rhyme or reason. It could be streaming off wifi or cellular or it could be something downloaded for offline listening. It's infuriating when I'm doing something and my phone isn't nearby or easily accessible (like if I'm prepping food and my hands are covered in food). Also even though my work LinkedIn account is linked to my personal LinkedIn account (via the two different email addresses), if I complete a course with my work LinkedIn Learning account (which I get for free), I can't add a certificate of completion to my personal LinkedIn account, even though they're both linked together."", 'I like that it maintains track of your progress, but it\'s hard to navigate in a video or see quickly where you are if you are looking at the contents screen. I wish there were a ""back 30 seconds"" button so I can have something repeated. I wish it integrated better with Android Auto so that I can listen like it\'s podcasts better. I used the AA today, but it didn\'t see the downloaded lessons. I love the offline feature. I love the whole concept. The lectures and tutorials and speakers are amazing.', 'I recently subscribed to LinkedIn Learning/Lynda and I am very much impressed overall with the service, both on the web version and the mobile versions of the apps. I have been able to find courses on everything I am looking for and there are usually a few instructors for each topic. One might think this is a terrible thing because of potentially repetitive information, but by simply watching the different instructors, you may find someone who makes you feel most comfortable which is most important in any learning experience. This is a fantastic service to support experts who are willing to take the time out to teach and enrich those who are willing to learn. Thank you for the service!', 'Good, not great. It desperately needs a ""Dark Mode"" option. I really like that there is an option to turn the video off and only listen to the audio, however there\'s an odd glitch that keeps courses from automatically continuing when the screen is off (in my pocket), I have to unlock the phone and go to the app and it will begin playing again. Other than that, this app is great.', ""They've included a larger number of courses that were on other learning platforms and rebranded them. The problem is so many are outdated or low quality. My biggest issue is the price isn't justified for the amount of high quality original content. I think you're way better off saving your money and looking for sales on individual courses in other platforms or wait until you have time to binge watch a bunch of courses and issue for just one month."", ""Has all of the features needed. I love downloading the courses to the phone so that I can learn while away from a decent signal. It's also very easy to remove the video from the phone to clear up storage. A higher resolution video option would be great. sometime seeing instructor's screens in 720p resolution isn't always the best."", 'Great application! Well worth the monthly fee! What you learn can improve your skills in many different areas in job related skills... and some in personal success and achievements too! What I learned in one course paid for the entire year service! All I do is, I use it to broadcast to my TV through Google Chrome. What I would like, however, if it would be back available on the Roku app as well as there is only a limited version available now, not the full version. Thank you...', ""The videos are good and educational. The issue I have is that after a few lessons completed, I was no longer able to add a new skill or lesson to my profile. I reached out to tech support and appeared to receive a response from a bot. I was instructed to uninstall and reinstall the app to fix the problem and it didn't resolve the issue. When responding again about the unsatisfactory results, they closed the ticket."", ""Problem if you want to run this app on a tablet and split the screen to simultaneously watch videos and write with your note taking app. Video will stop playing (audio continues) when writing notes in split screen. A quick workaround is to use a browser app like Chrome instead of this app to play the course videos. However, I am prompted to open the LinkedIn Learning app again for end of chapter quizzes. If the video playback issue in split screen gets fixed, I'd happily give this 5 stars."", ""The learning and videos are good, but the app is a little problematic. The quizzes time-out sometimes, also selecting answers is annoying because it thinks you're selecting an answer when really you just want to see the next multiple choice option. Download to play later works better if you download when you have wifi and watch when you have shoddy internet. If you don't download and try to watch in bad internet... well, you won't. The buffering will take forever, the quality will dip, and you may have to re-watch the same section over and over. Basically, use wifi. If on the road, download beforehand. I also sometimes get the issue of watching a video and it not registering as being watched. Otherwise the content is very good."", 'If you are looking for beginner, intermediate or continuation training on almost anything you can think of, this is the app to use. Each lesson is broken down into small blocks with quizzes, it is easy to follow along. I have found so many management training courses here where I can continue improving my skills as a manager, leader, and mentor at any career I choose.', ""Hasn't worked for months. It stays either on the loading screen or the login screen. I first downloaded this in late 2019 and it worked great until an update came along. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling many times with no luck. I've waited patiently for a fix, but 4 or so months on and it's still broken. I've given up on it."", ""LinkedIn learning is great, almost. The worst thing about it is trying to login through your organization or school. It just doesn't work and you have to sign in through the desktop site for it to work. The great thing about it is the ability to download courses. Sadly it's only for mobile and watching videos on a phone while working on my laptop suck. There is hope install BlueStacks on a computer and you can work from a dual monitor setup and it is a dream come true. Please make a desktop app."", 'Does not work at all. I have an account online all set up. I have tried to log in several times on this app. I copy and paste the email and password so I know they\'re correct. The app goes to an error screen that only says ""Something broke. Looks like we\'ve taken the wrong exit here."" This happens if I log in with my LinkedIn or school account. The website is great. App is useless.', ""Roll back the update. It has an audio only function, so there's no need for background play. The link you provided below asking me to email you doesn't take me to an email form/client. Anyway, when turning the phone into landscape the video should become full screen. Do you know how difficult it is to land on that little full screen button?"", ""Buggy and missing features. The mobile webpage is much better. I'm working through multiple learning paths and need my notebook. Can't access notes or add new ones. That alone makes having the app pointless. I was hoping the app would make it easier to find my way into the learning paths but LPs, courses and video are mingled. Worse than the mobile site. Please go back to how Lynda had it. Tree format. LP/courses/videos. Let me drill down to the thing I'm looking for."", ""Don't want to give full 5 but better than 4. I like it has a lot of tech stuff I want and have added other important life lessons that can help anyone. What I think takes away a full 5 stars is they need to add an attribute to videos if the video can be only listened to as in it does not have nesscary visual information. This way you can search for them. I like to listen when doing other things but pointless when they are explaining how to do something and need to see it."", ""I'm sorry that some of you didn't get what you needed from your courses, but I had a really great experience with both courses I signed with. The instructors, Dennis Taylor and Annyce Davis, were awesome. I was annoyed in the beginning that I couldn't find the transcripts right away and that they weren't uploaded for a while, but they eventually appeared. But the app experience was fine for me. I had more of an issue using the course on desktop."", ""I finish my courses in a learning path, but when I go to print my certificate it looks like gibberish. It is not clear what the certificate is for. Waste of time if I have no certificate to show for. *Update: I was contacted by LinkedIn Support and was given instruction to fix this issue. I've so far been pleased with how quickly they respond with an accurate solution to a problem. I've adjusted my rating from 1 to 4 stars due to the great support."", 'mobile is missing many features from the browser version, including transcript of videos, that make it frustrating at times. Sometimes gets confused on what you have and havent watched. videos dont get very big on mobile even in fullscreen mode, any small text is impossible to read, any cursor impossible to follow. there is an audio only option which is great. navigation is fine, search is good. sometimes limited learning on topics.', ""Highly intuitive, seamless e-learning app. I'm blown away by the options to cast to my devices from my phone if I want to watch the videos on large screen on my sofa. There is also offline downloading of the material, attachments with learning material and the option to easily add any course certifications to your LinkedIn profile. The courses are laser-focused and of high quality- not just thrown together for an extra buck. There are plenty of different classes and the instructors are engaging."", ""Signs me out everyday, so I have to re login. Audio only toggle button does not work. Downloads don't display for a while once logged out, and you cannot choose the quality or type of download (audio only/+video). All the features are there that should make it work well, but none of them are refined enough to work the way they should."", ""App is ok but has flaws at times. It stopped tracking time towards my goals, then suddenly started working and then it stopped again. Sometimes it will just never load at the beginning. I've tried numerous installs again with no difference. I really love LinkedIn Learning and would like more consistency with the app."", ""Works well but there are two issues. I have to wait a long time to access my downloaded videos when I'm offline; it leaves options blank until the app stops trying to access the internet. I know many deam android tablets dead but as a tablet user I would appreciate it if I could set this app in landscape mode at the very least."", ""In terms of usability Lynda was much better, especially the search feature. At the minimum stop listing random tiny modules from various courses when one search for some stuff, this does not add any value, rather the search should list down links to the 'whole course' sorted based on to what extent the searched keyword item is covered in the respective course. Course duration should not be more than 2hrs, ideally 1 hr or lesser."", ""This is by far the best online learning experience I have ever encountered! The extra tools available are very user friendly. Tag stuff you want to view again or skip sections you already know. You can even join groups in the courses to work with others taking the course too. I set a goal to do 30 minutes a week and because it's a great format with useful information, I average 2 hours a week. There's courses in here for everyone, you gotta try it!"", ""Horrible app. Downloads and videos hang when signal strength intermittently changes and never recover. Courses don't start playing even when partially downloaded. Search tool terrible- results are not selected or organized by topic. Search just pulls whatever courses that contain keyword as part of course information, so pretty useless because you have to sort through many irrelevant results. No intuitive course preview from search. i have to use this app for work and hate it."", ""The video screen is small. I think it's meant just for mobile phones, not for Chromebooks or large screens. I can't find a way to maximize it to fill the screen like the Lynda app and all other video training apps. It's no different than the regular Linkedin app. You have a small video at the top and menus and places to post underneath."", ""This app is amazing. Can't get enogh of it. It works really well and has tons of educational, and professional courses to work throgh. However there is no transcript for mobil devices so I take notes accordingly. The collections design could be better since it sometimes does not show a collection you have made if you have more than 15 collections with more than 20 or 15 courrses in these collections. But overall amazing and brilliant work."", 'The phone app doesnt load anything, just gives the error; ""It\'s not you, its us."" I cant access any courses and there seems to be no fix. I\'ve tried uninstalling and other fixes I could find, but none have worked. Don\'t pay for premium if your main access to the learning center is through your phone. Doesn\'t make sense to pay for something you can\'t access.', ""way too much buffering. I don't have this problem with any other streaming app. Only LinkedIn learning app. The functionality is fantastic but every 30 seconds I have to wait 15 seconds for at the buffer. And there is no option available to change the quality of the stream."", 'I use this with a corporate subscription through my employer. i like linkedin learning, but this app needs improvement. i am taking a course (ruby part 1) and it has a video. \'no way to watch it on my phone in full screen with my 6 inch pixel! i cannot get the ""table of contents"" ""drawer thing"" below the video to autohide or just stop displaying. it covers a third of the screen and it obscures the bottom portion of the video. that is just obnoxious. fix and i will up my rating.', 'I love LinkedIn learning, but it needs help for tablet viewing. When using app on mobile cell phone, it auto adjusts to the screen size. When using on a Samsung tablet, and full screen landscape, the video is cut off on left and right side. The only way to see it in full, is to use tablet in vertical mode. Using the tablet vertically, makes the video only a little bigger than if I used my cell phone. Please correct so I can watch full screen horizontally on my Samsung S3 tablet. Thank u!', ""It's okay I guess.... It plays videos, but it doesn't allow you to download them in higher quality at least on my tablet which has the ability with other apps. Also, the most annoying problem is that after I change the storage location to SD card it always reverts back to internal storage."", ""This is such an awesome database of useful content! The app is easy to navigate and find what I'm looking for. The only complaint I have is if I'm in audio-only mode, and my screen is locked, when a video finishes, it won't play the next one until I unlock my screen. it's odd and quite annoying, but not a huge deal."", '""Upgrading"" from Lynda to LinkedIn Learning was more of a downgrade, seeing how I can no longer download and view courses offline on my laptop, which is the preferred hardware to watch tutorials since I can actually follow along. Using my phone to watch tutorials only work with courses I\'m already familiar with, or that are entirely explanation based without follow along instructions, which aren\'t many. I\'ve used Lynda for years, so I\'m confident the courses are quality, bring back desktop app!', 'I mostly use as a supplement for book study. However, this app is gaining momentum as a trusted primary source for me. I hope to see the tracks a little more defined in the future though. Sometimes it can be difficult trying to identify the path to travel. Otherwise -- great app.', ""This is a hub of all the required learnings for a corporate employee. It not only includes the corporate skill related courses but also the skills of personal development. One may find many advance courses for which it might have cost more anywhere else but luckily it's all accessible here in just a single subscription.

When I\'m taking a break from my career obligations, I enjoy watching a plethora of videos. These videos include educational ones as well. One of my favorite channels for the past several years has to be Crash Course! They make learning fun! From World History, to Engineering, to even Chemistry and A&P.

The UI is excellent in most cases, Thought Bubble did a great job and I love the inside jokes in the loading bar. I do think however that the UX needs some work, as its not as straightforward to start watching content as I think it should be. When you go to a course it shows a list of screenshots, but it seems obvious these should be episode links to start playing videos. The goal should be get to content in 3 taps, like 3 clicks on a website.', ""Very very useful, though when downloading a deck, I have to keep the particular page open otherwise it will be cancelled and I have to restart it all over again.

THANK YOU!"", ""The flashcards are great, the video quality is as great as always. Reason why I put 5 stars is that I suggest to add a video player in the app itself, because when it redirects to youtube, it's kind of useless. Also I don't think the idea of having to download the course first to access it is a good one. Some people dont have big storage in their phone, give us the option to just stream and use it online, and another option to download. Great app for studying, nonetheless."", 'This app is great! I love the flashcards as they test us on all the important parts of the topics. Would love to see more decks for other subjects as well!

The fact that it is completely free is incredibly thoughtful and will obviously supply great amount of benefits for all users :D I'm optimistic for the decks that will become available but until then I look forward to understanding more about the human anatomy!

My only problem is in the app the circle gets stuck while downloading and its not clear that if it is downloading or not and also if we press back once even accidentally then it gets reset and you have to start again. But overall love this app and also that its for free. Now i can learn whatever i want. Thankyou.', ""I know the app is just released, but it's very clunky. There should be a way to see just the courses I've followed, instead of having to scroll through the entire list to find the ones I'm interested in. Also, why do I need to download everything?

Usually, I dislike it when people make an informative video while speaking quickly but because these videos are consistent in the rate that they are speaking it isn't annoying to me. The information is great and then humor is relevant and witty. Thankyou for creating these and please make more!! Is there a climate change or global warming or recycling crash course??? Thanks!! -Danaya Maxwell"", ""At last I'm able to get inside the app, though it took time the content is worth learning for everyone. Of course it is getting redirected to youtube, it ain't a problem for me, I can access all the crash course courses from a single app and at the same time learn using the decks. Which otherwise is not possible with youtube alone. So, this app allows to practice what is taught in videos."", ""It's really cool to be able to see the course in youtube and in the app. The favourites and voting system still have some problems.

Hope to see improvements"", ""I love cras course's content, the amount of effort in the videos is ridiculous and it helps so much, my only problem is that it takes absolute ages to download a deck and the indicator doesnt even make it clear if its downloading or not, a progress bar or a percentage complete would help a lot but this ring is not working at all"", 'Had low expectations for this to be honest, but it exceeded them in almost every way! Definitely great for education, as it is simple yet memorable. The U.I. is easy to manipulate and the whole app and all of its elements are free, what is not seen often today.', 'Amazing app! I like how everything is organized and can be found easily. A built-in player is needed as the videos are already present on YouTube and it becomes a bummer when you are directed to youtube to watch videos. Other than that great app!', 'I really love Crash Course and was super excited when they announced the launch was announced, the content you guys provide for free is amazing!! As others have said here before, the app could use some fine tuning on the UI and fix a few their bugs and we should be good to go!', ""I really love Crash Course and very much wanted this to work.

I've had one lesson, and I liked the easy interface of the app. I learned about the myriad of tools that Photoshop has to offer, and I'm anticipating what skills I will acquire by the end of the class.

Highly recommended', ""I've now completed 3 lessons in the initial 28-day free trial period. The lessons are clear, step by step, well illustrated and organized, and I've already learned a great deal. I'd hoped for the ability to be more interactive, and it would be nice to be able to ask questions on the site AFTER a lesson is finished (issues arise when I attempt to apply what I've just learned). There also seem to be some technical glitches, both on my PC & the app. Over all though, I'm very pleased- will continue!"", ""So far a great experience. I love the concept of setting up the course with designated class times. The tool kit is a great reaource in addition to the ability to view previously recorded classes. I look forward tolearning my new skill & putting it to use. Downside, as everyone has mentioned, it is going to cost you a substantial amount to get the additional resources but what's that to being able to turn your skill into a business? You have to invest at some point. Also, way too many emails."", 'Pretty good for what it is. I enrolled in the Graphic Design program and I had my first lesson. I\'ve been to a private art school for a degree (never finished) and this seems to be giving the same information, except in a more diluted form. The thing I have the biggest issue with is the constant emails and urging you to get a toolkit. If you\'re paying (I\'m using the 30 day free trial), shouldn\'t you automatically get that? Or maybe get a decent discount. Paying $40 per module (which only has 2 lessons!) on top of a monthly subscription seems like quite a bit. And then also having to pay to get your certificate/""diploma"" is a bit ridiculous as well for a subscription-based learning app.', ""The content is excellent and I love that you can watch the recordings after attending the class so that you can go back and see anything you might have missed. The only thing that I didn't like was how much you got spammed by pop ups asking you to buy toolkits and hard copy diplomas. It made the site/app hard to navigate on your phone because it took up a decent size of the screen and never seemed to go away even after hitting the X button. That being said, I stuck with it because the content was great and the instructors were very knowledgable and easy to follow."", 'Firstly, I just completed the first lesson, which was pretty informative. I did not like that I could not pause during the lesson time. However, after the lesson was over, you can listen to the recording where it allows you to pause. I cannot be certain how well the course is from one lesson, but going off the first lesson I will at least continue till the end of the module. Secondly, I also find it annoying when they keep trying to get you to buy the toolkit when I keep rejecting the offer. Lastly, when the lesson is completed you are supposed to be able to complete a quiz and turn in your assignment, but they are both locked. From my understanding, the lessons should take an hour, mainly 30 minutes of information and the other should be spent completing the assignments. If the assignments are not going to be open then it just wastes your time. Overall, I would recommend trying out the course before committing, everyone learns differently.', ""I'm really enjoying the app so far and learning a lot. My only issue is with the large amount of pop up adds and emails, and the fact there's no option to pause the class. I'm a mother to two boys who I'm homeschooling so I need the option to be able to pause the video lessons instead of just going back after the class and rewatching the whole thing. Other than that I've had no issues so far and I'm excited to continue my courses."", ""Good app when you're computers not handy, but there are a few things that would make it so much better. I'll text support specifics on the issues I'm running into with the app. Getting less user friendly all the time! Now they've taken away the ability to download recorded lessons so you can study off-line. Too bad! That was one of the best features of this app....."", ""Missed my first class because of a player error on Chrome and edge. Tried this app and it didn't work either. I finally tried Chrome on my phone and it worked... After I missed the first quarter of the lesson. Not a good first impression. And the only support option I saw was an ai bot. Oh and God forbid you get a phone call during the session. Plus it says the recording is now available since I missed most of it due to technical issues, but of course it's not. Unbelievable."", ""The course is fast paced, but good! Just watch and try to take a few mental notes then go back and watch the recordings and practice. Initially misleading, as the course is NOT free, although it is low cost. So, say it is cheap because it ISN'T free. It is often difficult to sign into the lessons and the 3 family members that I added either didn't get to login or were being asked to pay, although I already paid. Something on the site is always asking for some payment which is frustrating!"", ""Pretty user friendly. Don't like how everything cost money and how they bring it up every class, I understand that is where they get their money during free trials, but its sort of obnoxious. There is a lot of great information and it is improving my knowledge on nutrition a lot. I plan to cancel the subscription after the classes are finished but sounds like that will be a task based off other reviews."", ""I want to focus on the overall learning experience and the user interface of the app/program. I'm giving it a 4 star because I get at least 5 emails a day regarding my classes (the more classes you have the more emails you will get).

On top of that you are inundated with messages through email and text about EVERYTHING!!!! I easily got at 6 - 7 emails and another 6 -7 texts each and every single day. Plus the app set notifications as well. The information in the classes were just not worth the hassle.', ""I just did my first lesson. It was a little fast for me but having the ability to go back after its done and rewatch it and pause where I need to to take notes (because yes I'm a note taker) was very helpful. I agree with a couple of the other reviews that there is an over abundance of notifications about the class, but over all I am very happy with my experience and look forward to more lessons."", 'Promising app! Content is organized, relevant, nicely presented, and detailed. Room for improvement: Navigation is cumbersome at first, not quite intuitive. There are editing errors in the quizzes and assignments. The plethora of emails, texts, and app notifications is enough to stress a person out. Many could be combined into just one. I am really excited to see this app grow and expand. Once the quirks are attended to, it will be a fantastic way to keep minds active, growing, and engaged!', 'More of a hassle. I was interested in some of the course options. I signed up for the free 4 week trial. I attempted to cancel 3 days into the free trial, it took a survey, multiple questions, and still was directed to call in. Two months later I was charged $69.99 for a service I thought was canceled and never accessed the content. And still am being pushed around about getting my refund.', ""there's some bugs in the app sometime when you download the course but it won't let me watch it and view it offline. the information is great, but it is also hard to reschedule or figure out how to get a better time for certain courses. for example when you sign up for a class you can pick two days and a Time but if something happens and you need to change it and it's very hard to do so through the app. Or trying to reschedule for the same course after taking it before is also difficult."", 'The courses are informative and eye opening but, the bad thing is that the instructor goes really quickly and you cannot pause or stop the session. When the class is done, they say you can ""re-watch"" the session but that is not the case. I tried doing that because I missed some important notes, but it never let me re watch anything. Please fix that, everyone has different learning styles and paces!', ""App is pretty useful as you can attend classes/videos from your phone, although changing class times and your schedule could be made easier as I have run into some technical issues of changing the class schedule times. Also I wish I didn't receive a million notifications and emails and text all the time trying to sell me stuff or updates- it is a bit of overkill. 'Ad blindness' comes to mind, a term I recently learned while doing the Digital Marketing course on here... As for the content- I have only completed my first week of classes for two courses I am doing. So far it has been decently informative and helpful, although sometimes the classes come off more as recordings than interactive courses. Also for one of my classes I had a different 'instructor' on the second lesson and I would of liked to keep the one I had in the first lesson to have some consistency. Otherwise I am thrilled to start learning on these courses. I am curious to see if they will compare better to other online courses as there are many many options out there."", 'So far so good. I will update this as a I go along, the classes have been very informative and I do feel some progress happening. I am concerned about their one click purchase. If you click it, it has been bought. There are no prompts or anything, including accidental clicks or taps. Their layout is nice but still needs major work. The countdown for the next class on your dashboard will be hard to read as it gets squished together. There are some errors on the website that are mostly visual...', ""Took a graphic design course. Good info and instruction but I'm not a beginner and there didn't seem to be a way to skip to more advanced lessons without watching all the beginner ones. I rescheduled each class so that they were one right after the other so I could go back and watch the recording and speed up the videos. Lots of marketing emails. Canceling is a hassle. You have to call in. They try to extend your trial and other things to keep you subscribed so you have to be firm to cancel."", 'So far this has been very informative. There are too many notifications, (at least 10 notifications on lesson days), some notifications are even sent twice via the same media, and it really pushes the purchase of the toolkit, etc. but has been giving me a great deal of useful information. It would be nice to be able to pause the lessons the first time through, in case of a phone call, or a bathroom break. Promised things that were never delivered on. (Free kit for rating for one.)', ""This app seems to function well for the purposes. The courses themselves are still being explored but seem to provide good information thus far. My instructor's presentation sounds like she is reading from a script, and her script is as if she is talking to us live, but there is no actual interaction so it seems to me to be prerecorded. That's a little weird, but the information itself is good."", 'This app sends way too many notifications. And they are mostly to say ""you\'ve missed a class, reschedule"", even though I was in the class. Occasionally, my classes will also disappear from my class list, too. I\'ve been very happy with how the courses are taught and the amount of information given in them, but the constant bombardment is a bit much, and the phone calls are extremely unnecessary.', 'I just completed the first lesson in the bookkeeping course. The content was interesting. There was something off about the size of the video, and I felt the video went too fast to ask quesions. But, I was able to replay the video at my own speed afterwards, and was able to take good notes. I am looking forward to the remainder of the lessons!', 'So far the courses are on point and have helpful information. The user interface is easy, however I have had a difficult time finding exactly where to click to view on a desktop. Sometimes I run late and get messages that I missed the class. I also get annoyed with the amount of reminders that keep coming on email and text. It over the top. Especially since I signed up for 4 concurrent classes. These could be consolidated into a daily single message? I would also like to view 2 classes in a row on the same day but have to jump through the scheduling hoops to make that happen. The music classes are like that. Learn the skills, the go to the practical application immediately.', ""Great information and courses, although the bot that answers the questions on the side of a class could be more helpful. The pricing is pretty cheap but I found it through an advertisement that told me I'd be taking a free course and then immediately was taken to a page to pay for course materials. These minor issues aside, the professor for Graphic Design seems very knowledgeable and with a kind demeanor. The slides that play during class are also very helpful!"", 'I was extremely excited to dive into learning more about data analysis but this course is disappointing at best. The additional packet of information they charge for is NOT worth the purchase. It contains nothing more than the word-for-word script used during ""class"". I was really hoping for additional information to help me learn. The examples are not easy to follow, as they leave out important steps (I assume they think you already know some of this stuff). I was disappointed to learn I could not get a refund, instead they gave me access to another course. Well, the 1st wasn\'t easy to navigate, not really sure how much better or useful taking another course would be.', 'Very misleading. Was very interested until the immediate ""purchase course materials"" popped up for $40 along with several other ""optional"" purchases that seemed essential. The whole point in starting the trial was the fact it was free. If your faced with obstacles that will not allow you to properly take part in the course unless you make a purchase, why do you advertise it as ""free""? Further more, after reading comments that others have left, I\'m wondering if in fact I will be charged anyway.', ""I wanted to do my first class on my laptop but it would never load from the dashboard. When it finally did load it wouldn't let me join the class already in progress (30 seconds). Ended up doing it on my phone. Disappointed it wouldn't let me rotate the screen so it was bigger. I will watch the replay to be sure I didn't miss anything. The actual content and pace seem good."", ""The course looks as if it will be fun and interesting. But I'm very disappointed that it appears the lessons are not kept up to date. In my first lesson there are 2 recommended software downloads. One has been discontinued and the other has quite a few newer versions available from what is listed in the lesson. I'm not sure which version I should download if any and I don't know a replacement for the discontinued one. No support on weekends is another disappointment."", 'Full of advertising! They offer a free class but require you to buy the ""toolkit"" and the diploma for 40 bucks each. I attended my first class (watched a video) and the interaction piece was super annoying and unhelpful. I know a fair amount about nutrition, and I wasn\'t sure if I\'d learn anything. I did pick up one small interesting fact that I didn\'t know before. I\'ll try a few more classes. They really go all out trying to make sure you engage, sending many reminders on EVERY platform...', ""The instruction and content are solid so far. Although the first 4 weeks are free (that's just for module 1 of 4 - fair enough), you are asked for your credit card right away. So, be careful about pop-ups and 'single click' buttons. The platform constantly tries to up-sell class notes, etc., all at a click of a button. If you're not paying attention, it's easy to spend $40 straight away."", ""Attempted several times to cancel subscription before I was charged seeing that the platform isn't as helpful as it could be. I call to cancel and the automated system sent me through the same list of options several times with no option to speak to a person and my account was still charged, though I was never even able to attend a full class. I am very disappointed at the tedious nature of the cancelation process."", ""I got a 4 week course thru T-Mobile, used it to take an Excel class.

I had to uninstall and reinstall for it to work but now it's great. I like the download feature because it's useful on airplanes and subways. I like that you can play at different speeds too which is great if someone talks very slow or rambles on before they get to the point."", ""I'm sorry to say, the UX of the android app is pretty bad. For example, after poking about quite a lot, I was unable to even change my profile picture. On the contrary, their website, even on a mobile browser is MUCH more usable. Here is an examples of my frustrations: - To browse by category, the user needs to scroll all the way to the bottom and then click on a dropdown menu. On the other hand a simple hamburger menu with categories would easily make the app much more usable."", ""Glitchy and hard to navigate. For all the classes available, this app makes it really difficult to explore options. You have to KNOW exactly what you want to learn, OR just be willing to start any old class and see what happens. But if you are interested in exploring a topic, the categories are just too broad. Plus, you can't access most of the course 'extras' and none of the documents, so say you want to learn to paint a dog in watercolor, you can't see the instructor's PDF sketches."", ""I love this app. I've been using my downtime to learn a lot of useful skills. I was going to try to just learn what I could during the free trial, but just ended up purchasing the year subscription. There's a lot of relevant content. I prefer their set up compared to udemy's. Rather than taking your chances on buying one class, you can try out a variety for one price."", ""Skillshare as a service is pretty legit as far as I can tell, I just have the free service for now as I browse the library. The app, however, is weird to navigate, and not particularly user freindly. It took me a bit to figure out how to search the catalog of classes & add classes to my list. Also, could use a night mode. The constant downward scrolling with the white background made me very motion sick even with my phone's brightness on lowest setting."", 'The service itself is awesome and has been very helpful in creating an environment of learning in my life. I have so many new things I know! The app could use a little work, mostly in the playback features. Sometimes the next lesson will just notnplay and i have had to reset the app to get it to work. Love the service, a little work on the app and this goes to five stars, easy.', ""Awful experience. I paid $99.99 for this service in 2018 and constantly found myself unable to access content because videos were locked in spite of me being a premium member. When I could use the app my saved classes constantly disappeared and video load times took forever because you can only watch in HD. Needless to say I stopped using it after a very short time. I have now been charged for another year subscription for 2019 because it apparently auto renews and have been denied a refund even though the app still doesn't work, I haven't used it, and I requested the refund within 24 hours of being notified of the charge. $99.99 is no small amount to lose for an app that isn't functional."", ""It's a fantastic app with some amazing tutorials. Definitely the best one on the market. The search option is pretty iffy if you're looking for a specific course, even typing the exact name couldn't find me the course, but I eventually found the one I was looking for anyway. Outside of that minor inconvenience the app runs great, looks great and is extremely helpful."", ""Let us have specific control over the video quality, holy geez. It's so freaking basic. Instead, I just have to keep rewinding 30 seconds and *hoping* that it decides to switch to a higher quality so that I can actually see anything. I often have to rewind 6 or 7 times before it decides to switch quality. Or at the very least, let us choose specifically which lessons to download, instead of having to download the whole dang class. Not all of us live in Silicon Valley with hyper fast internet."", ""Love Skillshare! For instructors, there could be some additions included for better structuring of content. For example, the ability to add sections in a course and the ability to add articles or attachments as course lectures. So some features could be improved so that teachers may be more effective in their teaching, but overall, it's an excellent platform."", ""The service looks good.  I haven't watch classes yet but they look like they will be good though.  However that app has one glaring flaw that is inexcusable in 2019 that makes the app itself 1 star automatically in my book.  You can not download videos to your SD card. At least I can't find a way to do it.  So you have to fill the device storage up with videos if you want to download them for offline viewing.  Making that feature pretty much unusable unless you have a basically empty phone as even a 36 min class is over half a gig.  Which is not surprising since HD videos are large files.  Which is why with competently made video apps you can download them to the SD card instead of the device storage.  If you could download the classes to the SD card it would be a 5 star app as the rest works well and is simple to use."", ""I haven't used any of the classes they offer YET, but I would like to rate this app 5 stars for the excellent customer service they provided! I was mistaken and didn't realize that after the free trial, I would be automatically billed their annual amount of $99. Immediately i was horrified and reached out to their CS with a simple email stating that I didn't mean to pay, and within an hour the amount was immediately refunded back to me. Thanks Skillshare for understanding and being awesome!"", ""Ok so I've had this app for a day thanks to GMM. I got 2 months free. So I tried it out... absolutely wonderful!! Love the courses. Easy to use. Lots of helpful stuff. Didn't realize there was so much stuff to do with my career/passion. Cinematography. Lots of camera and editing videos. Love it! Will most likely be paying for it once the 2 months run out. Only downside is it seems to take a bit to load. And I wish it had features like YouTube. Skip or back 10 seconds. And auto rotate.. but oh well. Still a good site/app"", 'So far, I am enjoying the couple lessons Ive done. However, the teachers have mentioned handouts or attachments and what not which I have not been able to find in the mobile app version. Also, on every class now, if I pause and move off the video to either another app or just to another page within skillshare once I go back to the class and hit play it wont play. I have to completely close out of skillshare and stop the running of the app totally and reboot before it will play again. Fyi.', ""At first I wasn't sure if the subscription fee would be worth it. I thought I would try the free trial and cancel before the due date. Wow, was I surprised. Skillshare offers a multitude of phenomenal classes. I find myself clicking this app instead of playing games. I have tried classes I never even thought I would be interested in. I love the variety of offerings and will most likely never get through my wishlist of courses. No glitches or lag time, the app runs flawlessly, love it!"", ""I've used skillshare for a little over a month now, and its one of the best investments I've made. I can learn anything I want with the click of a few buttons. Navigation could be a little easier, but its great overall. As far as it charging people for the service goes, its not Skillshare's responsibility when consumers can't handle their finances. I pay annually for my subscription and have yet to have any issues. People need to be more responsible. Excellent service though."", ""This app is Awesome! Has a ton of different courses on different subjects. Easy to use and understand. Can be interactive, sometimes the instructor urges you to start a project with them or apply what was taught within the course to a current project you're working on and to share with you're perfect on skillshare. Best of all you can go at your go at your own pace, no rush."", ""Great easy flow app & website, content is (generally) quality. I dont know if this is a thing with the app but the keyword search seems off, not pulling up things even if I typed in the title, also I don't think it has actual key WORD searches. The other mini problem is on the app it autoplays classes after the intro, which sucks if your slow /have a busy life. You kinda end up starting a class you don't want to."", ""I didn't know that I was on the lookout for something like skillshare for a long time, till I found Skillshare. This is one online learning app that opens all doors to learning at your convenience and at a very reasonable price. You do not have to pay for different courses separately. You just pay the annual subscriptions and you have access to myriad courses on a variety of topics. The instructors are top-notch and the way the courses are delivered is better than most I have seen. Great job!!"", ""Skillshare = Awesome! App Feedback: The courses never save/return where I'm at, the app always starts me at the first video, or some random spot in a video I already watched. The video player is also finicky. It doesn't always recognize what I touched (enter or exit fullscreen, play/pause, touch to open/close the overlay to see video options). And a recent bug from the Android 10 update, while I'm watching a fullscreen video and when the phone goes into battery saver mode the app glitches.""]","['org.domestika', 'com.udemy.android', 'org.coursera.android', 'org.edx.mobile', 'com.tgc.greatcoursesplus']",https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.skillshare.Skillshare&hl=en&gl=us

And when it's not doing those things, it can be painfully slow. I suspect much of the slowness is due to a new back-end system implemented by the Great Courses. Things have gotten substantially worse after the upgrade to the new system (when all of the device passwords were reset). Specific bugs: 1) Speaking of passwords, the Android app has a 20 character limit for the password, even though the website will allow you to configure a longer password. There's no warning about this website. I had to figure it out the hard way. 2) The app allows you to download content so you don't have to stream and incur data plan charges. But inexplicably (I think because they never tested this), when you start to play downloaded content while not connected to wi-fi, you get a pop-up warning you that you need to change settings to allow data streaming because you're not connected to wi-fi. But this is the whole point of downloading content. And if you try to exit popup, you have either changed the setting (which I don't want to do - I downloaded the content because I *don't* want to stream over my data plan) or you haven't changed it and playback stops. So I just leave the dialog open and then app eventually crashes once I'm back in wi-fi range. Great... I haven't received a response to any of my recent attempts to contact Customer Service. As a long-time customer of The Teaching Company / The Great Courses (since the time when courses were sent out on cassette tapes) this is disappointing. They used to have very good, responsive customer service. It's a shame because the app and customer service are so bad that I'm ready to cancel."", ""I love the Great Courses, and based upon the content, I was planning on extending past the 30 day trial. However, I'm not sure I will. On my Samsung phone, it pauses every couple of minutes and gets really annoying to keep pressing play. This could be very dangerous for those that try to listen and drive. Also, on my phone, I have to exit the app a couple times in order for my content to appear. The roku app won't keep you signed in so it takes a while to sign in and it's really annoying."", ""The content is great. The app is a little slow and buggy sometimes but that's not a huge deal. The problem I had was strange and was never resolved. I did the free trial with intensions to renew and pay full price the next month. The next month rolled around and I was charged for the subscription, but my account was deactivated. I emailed the team to try getting this figured out and they still haven't fixed this. They refunded me, and they told me they'd fix it but it's been almost a month."", 'The app loses all my information llike Favorites or Downloads when it remains dormant for a period of time. I have to kill the app and restart it and it then remembers everything. In the past I had trouble accessing downloaded courses when I did not have an internet connection. It wants to reverify that you are an active member. I have not tested the latest version. Other than that, the app is great!. Finding, accessing and streaming a huge range of courses.', 'I love the material offered by The Great Courses, but the app has some issues. 1. Several days ago, I downloaded some lectures to listen while on a trip with limited internet access. Upon opening the app, I was greeted with the message ""We have made some changes that require you to upgrade to our latest version"" with no option to continue until the app was upgraded. Very annoying, and kind of defeats the whole purpose of downloading lectures. 2. During playback of lectures, the player will randomly pause, requiring me to manually restart. 3. No Android Auto support for audio lectures.', ""It's nice being able to take the courses with you on the go. The audio-only option allows me to listen in the car during my commutes. My only issue is I wish the size of the closed captions was adjustable. It is so teeny tiny on my S9 that it's pointless to try to use them. I don't really use this app as much as I would like because of this. I have a slight auditory processing issue and watching things with captions is very helpful for me."", ""Update: I added a star. The app is no longer struggling to load and play audio and video. Previous: The app itself is nice. But it really seems to struggle with audio and network interruptions - phone and sms. I've had to go as far as force stopping and purging local content to get it running normally again. It's unfortunate because it makes the product hard to enjoy."", ""Love the great courses but the app is terrible! Every single time I try to go back to where I left off it locks up, just loading forever. Occasionally I can do a search but cannot use the back button so no way to navigate to the menu, I just have to restart the app and loading in general is very slow so I'm never quite certain if I need to wait it out or restart. Once I actually get to the lectures playing audios/videos seems to work well."", 'The service is awesome but this app is an exercise in frustration. I will start a lecture and listen as I clean the house but invariably playback will stop and I have to pull out my phone, pause, then play again. It also never goes on to the next lecture without me having to do the same. It often stops playing new lectures altogether after two or three. Then I have to actually kill the app and restart it. This happens when downloading the lectures, too. It is pretty to look at, but I wish they had put more effort into smooth, reliable operation.', ""Best new feature: you can now download lectures in audio and listen offline. (Before, you could only download video lectures.) The app now marks your place in each lecture, even if you skip between lectures or courses. It now freezes much less often. If it gets wonky or slow, try restarting your phone. If you need to pause for more than a few minutes, quit the app and restart it when you're back. If you press play after pausing too long, it drops you at a random point in an earlier lecture."", ""Excellent value for the money. I listen to lectures in audio format when I'm driving for work and watch the videos when I have time at home. Seamless transitions between the two make it possible to keep up no matter what you're doing. I've learned so much thanks to these guys from Great Courses and Wondrium is just a step up in content. The only downside is poor app integration across devices. Don't count on seeing this on flex boxes, game consoles, or some other streaming devices."", ""Great content. Horrible app. Audio courses will play for 20 seconds and then stop so you have to keep pressing play every 20 seconds to get through the lecture. I thought the newest update would fix this, but it actually made it worse. Too many times I've opened the app to listen to a course and it simply wouldn't load. For a few days the app said I wasn't a member and didn't have access to the content. Really disappointing. I paid for a 3 month subscription and can't access anything."", ""There's so much content, and such a wide variety of lectures and courses to choose from along with guidebooks. Another awesome feature that's extremely useful for me is the ability to quickly switch from video format to audio format whenever I have to go somewhere or do something. My only recommended improvement would be to add something like a monthly credit to buy a singular lecture or course, and own it forever. Similar to Audible. All in all, great app. Recommend it a lot. 👍"", 'I love the Great Courses and was excited to subscribe to the Great Courses Plus. The content is excellent and the app is nicely designed. Unfortunately, I am unable to actually watch any video using the App. I have an app that runs in the background and updates information on my pull down menu every 5 minutes. Every time it updates, this App pauses the video or audio that is currently playing. Please try to fix this. If the app would automatically resume playing, it would be better. Thanks', 'The updated app includes the ability to download audio versions of each lecture, plus the associated guidebook. These are terrific improvements over the former version. Moreover, the functionality and user interface are great. However, I would still like to see the capability to download all lectures in a course with one button instead of clicking on all individually.', ""I really do not like this app. When it works it works well. When it screws up it does a great job! If your multi-tasking with this app you can forget about it. I paused my lecture, used GPS for around 15mins then went back to lecture and my lecture was gone. I had to restart and it doesn't restart from the beginning but it also doesn't restart from where it was initially paused either. That problem is bothersome but the app will aslo go as far as freezing up and will become unresponsive."", ""I like all the content the app has, however it's a little buggy. If I'm locking my screen , I can pause the app from the lock screen. However, if I click play from the lock screen, Not only does the course I want to listen to play, but also some random course I was listening too previously also starts playing. It's a little frustrating to have to open the app each time I want to resume my course"", ""I love the courses (selection and content), but the platform is terrible. I stream the courses at home and in my car. If I don't remember to open the app before leaving home, it does not recognize my ID and password when I try to use it in the car. When away from home,, I can't close the app because I have the same problem. Some of the older courses don't have an audio only option which uses more data if you stream them in your car. All the courses should have an audio only option."", ""The app used to be pretty bad and had a difficult to use UI. Also couldn't delete individual downloaded lectures, you had to delete a whole course of downloaded lectures. All these issues are now gone and the app runs much more smoothly now after an update that came out a late last year. Only thing I can think of that needs to change is making all lectures available for audio download, as I think there are still some that are available for video download only."", ""The content is wonderful. The app is not. It rarely remembers where I am in a lecture series, both within a given lecture and where I left off between them. It says that you can save the lectures to your SD card, but you can't. Also, the opening screen should be my watchlist, not some random collections of lectures in which I have no interest."", ""Edit: reduced to 1 star. After more than 2 years and hundreds of hours of lectures, I'm removing the app and canceling my subscription. Audio streaming has been failing to load with increasing frequency over the last year, and has now become entirely non-functional. Same issue on iphone X and Samsung S20+. Verizon, tmobile, wifi, all the same. I have one course to finish in video mode and I'll be canceling my subscription, and it's a real shame."", 'As the others said, the content is great. The lecturers are good, and the topics are many and interesting. The applications (be that on Win 10, Fire or Android) leave a lot to be desired. There is no consistency across the board (which happens when someone hires different contractors to build them without having an overall standard), and unfortunately the android app is just useless in my case because I cannot listen to the lectures, only watch them. Cancelled my subscription after an year.', ""Great content let down by a bad app: * You can download content, but you must be online to access (why bother?). * You cannot download audio only for many lectures, leading to needlessly big downloads/data. * When you download the video and let your screen sleep, the audio stops. * There's no easy way to see where you left off. * Way too much focus on video for what is great audio content. * No Android TV support at all. All in all, there's a lot that feels poorly thought out and woefully executed. The inability to play content offline is absurd. All the major streaming services have that figured out, but here it's a mess. I still kinda recommend the overall product, but the app makes it absolutely painful. It's a mess."", 'Good content. Greatest problem is that you cannot download the audio of a video course. Thus you have to stream it if you are away from wifi; not good if you have a limited data plan. Downloading the video and playing it later would work but for my battery being more quickly depleted by playing the video just to listen, not watch. May quit when my free trial is up.', ""This app has been amazing, there are so many learning opportunities. I've been listening mainly to history lectures as I work from home but there is so much more I'd love to dive deeper into when I have time. There was recently an issue where my subscription was canceled without my input but they helped me sort that out. Something to do with Google play, not the apps fault. Point being, they have always been very helpful to me when I need it."", ""TL;DR Wonderful learning tool if the audio playback worked consistently. App content has been great so far, but it's good I'm on a free trial because the audio playback is buggy. I drive truck so I want to be able to listen to audio in the background, but I often can't get it to start playing... The loading spinner spins and spins, but no audio. If I choose video, it normally starts in ten seconds or so, but then it stops playing when I send the app to background. It's an irritating Catch 22."", 'If you installed the upgrade that was pushed out on 2/12/2020 and are stalled at the sign in screen (just a spinning circle and the words, ""Signing In""), try going first to the ""Browse Courses"" option at the bottom of the screen and then use the sign in button that is available there. That was the only way I could get past the stalled ""Signing In"" screen that came up whenever I tried to sign in directly from the starting screen. Love The Great Courses Plus. Still room for improvements to the mobile app, but they\'re working on it.', ""The content is genuinely top-notch (I'm often quite surprised by the production quality) and had a wide variety of topics to choose from. The app is a little slow and sometimes buggy, but I expect it'll improve in time. Pricing is kind of expensive, but they're making new courses regularly so it doesn't seem like such a waste to me. I'm overall very happy with Wondrium."", ""Fantastic but dated. Catalogue is huge and the speakers well selected. My only complaint, and unfortunately it's a big one, is how dated all these lectures are. The ones I've listened to are all from the 2000's. Much has changed and been discovered since than. I'm left to wonder how come these arent being rerecorded every few years. Even once a decade would be in improvement.""]","['com.emeritus.mobile', 'com.alison.mobile.flutter', 'com.skillshare.Skillshare', 'fm.alpe.app', 'org.edx.mobile']",https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tgc.greatcoursesplus&hl=en&gl=us
