I didn't realize this when I first downloaded it and paid for a year because I thought I had to, but honestly thought the price was good for the quality of the product. Using the free version now, an ad plays at the end of each lesson, but are less obnoxious than some apps I use"", ""Great app, very intuitive. It teaches without ever speaking English, but never becomes too complicated. The hearts system is abysmal though, you can only make up to 5 mistakes, which are inevitable when learning new material, then you're not able to take new lessons for a few hours. This makes taking new lessons harder and practicing old material just to keep your streak the easiest option. The only way to stop this is to pay for Duolingo plus. To recap: great app, but harder for free learners."", ""I'm so tired of incorrect audio screwing up my scores, and now there's a bug that ruins player's streaks, which only really means anything if extrinsic motivation is a factor, but it's honestly what keeps a lot of people coming back every day. If they're not going to fix these problems, I don't see a reason not to find a better language learning app."", ""Overall the app is pretty good. However, that being said there's a lot of room to improve. First, I'm not 22 and find the whole game like experience annoying and condescending. I don't need points, gems, hearts etc. I would prefer statistics and quantified measurements. I would certainly consider a paid version but nowhere can I find the cost and features listed. I'm not going to buy anything unseen. Providing downloadable vocab lists and progress stats would be a great reason to pay."", ""I've used Duolingo almost 5 years, and learned a ton from it. The quality and depth of each language program is varied - if you aren't learning one of the major ones like French, German, Spanish, English etc. often it is less well-directed, and will offer less explanation, leaving much more for you to do on your own. In general though, it is perfect as an accessory alongside vocabulary, listening, and speaking practice when learning another language."", ""Update: I have to drop the stars because now I'm in the higher levels, the heart thing is preventing me from making any progress. I also can't compete on the leader board with paying subscribers. It's too bad, but I'm done - it's too frustrating. I have had a lot of fun learning Espa√±ol and freshening up my Deutsch. It's easy to fit in time to study everyday. Duolingo takes the intimidation out of learning a language and has taken the place of all the games on my phone!!!"", 'App is great most of the time!! It is impossible to talk to a person and I have easily lost 1000 credits using a streak freeze when I completed the excercise on the same day!! This may seem menial but it had cost me many hard earned points and I dedicate myself to reaching the 365 day streak. I have numerous screen shots but no way to fix the issue!!', ""Decent app and learning modules. The in app advertisements are a huge pain lately. After each lesson we noramlly have a short ad that you can skip after a short period. Now the ads do not seem to have that option and at the end of the add there is no way close out and continue learning. I must close the app and re-open the app to continue. This is the second time in the last 30 days this has happened. Third strike and you're out!"", ""I've been using Duolingo for about 3 YEARS! now, and really am enjoying the app. The pace of learning is totally up to you, and you can test out of easier levels if you already have some language familiarity. I appreciate the reminders, the variety of speaking reading and translating back and forth. There are challenges, practices, review of past mistakes, lessons, and even stories!!! Try it!"", ""While this has the potential to be a fun way to work on vocabulary for learning a language, the support for the app is nonexistent. The amounts of ads in the free version as well as being locked out for making mistakes makes it almost unusable, so I tried the premium version for my whole family. There were a lot of bugs and issues with getting access to features like following friends or in game power ups. The only thing you can do is to file a bug report, but I didn't get a reply or any help."", 'Duolingo is an excellent app for casual language learning. It is great for learning basic vocabulary, grammar, and does so in a variety of exercises and stories (which I love) to keep one busy. That said, one thing that disappoints me is the decline of the free version. I have used the app long enough to know when it was just ads, and no 5 lives. When they added gems, and the five lives, I knew microtransactions were coming, while ads would remain. First create a problem, then sell a solution', ""Great way to learn Spanish. Much better than text books and memorizing a lot of info. More like learning as a kid by hearing and repetition. Every once in a while though, my answer choice is covered by the check box so I can't respond correctly. Also, it doesn't recognize my microphone so I don't speak. Otherwise, happy with the app."", ""I find it useful for brushing up on a language I already know. I haven't used it to learn an unfamiliar language, but it seems less ideal for that because it doesn't really explain anything. E.g., when an answer is marked wrong, there's no explanation of what specifically was wrong. Obviously there's only so much they can do, since all they have are a bunch of candidate answers that they're matching against, but even with that, I think they could do better. The correct answer they offer may differ in multiple ways from the user-provided answer, but it often turns out that most of those difference are fine, and the real problem was just a hard-to-notice typo. That can result in the user doubting their own correct understanding and just learning to parrot what DL offers as correct. I think it would be better if they showed the closest candidate answer by edit distance, ideally highlighting the difference. I dislike the over-the-top gamification and social elements. I don't really want to solicit pats on the back from friends and family for every little achievement. No doubt their engagement metrics and subscriptions go up whenever they tweak the game to be more manipulative, but I'd turn that all off if it were an option. They added new voice models for their computer-generated text-to-speech for the purpose of having different characters with distinct voices. While the quality of the TTS in general is pretty good, I find it inconsistent, at least for the Italian. For one of the kid voices in particular, it can be really difficult to tell what consonant is supposedly being said. Even knowing from context which words are likely, it's sometimes a guessing game. I wish it were an option to switch to a different voice."", 'Duolingo is fantastic. I am truly enjoying this platform. It makes it extremely convenient and fun to learn a language in this manner. I took Spanish immersion classes my first year of college and spoke it off & on through the years. It has really started to come back. The format the exercises are in make it fun & relatively easy to work through. Cheers!!', ""I love duolingo so much. It's somewhat life-changing. It's an invaluable tool for language learning. It gives me really good brain exercise, and (more importantly) consistent brain exercise. The leader boards, daily reminders etc are so helpful and encouraging for keeping a consistent practice. I highly recommend it to people all the time. Thank you duo."", ""I'm on the 2 week trial to see if I want to buy it for the family. It's actually really good and motivating but once you get to level three you start having memorizing which nouns are masculine, feminine, and neuter. If you had the option to create flashcards (in this app) from each lesson on the words that you're struggling with; this would be a five-star app, no question."", ""It's a decent program, it mostly works as intended. However some longer words when forced to type the question when there is one word wrong but you can clearly see it is the correct word, will be counted wrong. When you speak into the phone it will occasionally not hear what you said and you lose a heart.. its a program designed to make you pay. I would recommend babbel over duolingo"", ""The app itself works as intended. Perhaps it works for some, not for me. It's far too discouraging. To advance, you are obviously competing with bots & people who are plus members. I get it; they want you to pay, but all the advertising pop ups ARE paying... If you work hard to move up, but for some reason can't spend the time, you get demoted and have to work your way back up. How is this encouragement? difficult to figure out sentence structure with no explanations. Too many negatives to list"", ""Duolingo is amazing if you want to learn a new language. With an ample choice of languages, you can pretty much learn any language you want. There is competition to keep you motivated which is great and if your friends join Duolingo, you can compete with them as well. The only problem I see in Duolingo is sometimes when you have to say the words of the language and you don't respond too fast, the audio will just mark you wrong. This may be a problem because of background noise or the system."", ""I think it's a great app, the way they do there adds is perfect, if it were any other way I would delete the app right away. I like that you have the option to have reminders on/off because I hate app reminders. (The following is an edit to the original 5 star review) This app is super buggy. It will allow you to have a 119 steak that your working on go to waste when it bugs out in the middle of a lesson and not allow you to continue. You'll have to restart your lesson after restarting the app."", ""I had trouble learning Spanish since high school. Duolingo has helped me so much. The lessons are broken down into short and engaging sections you can complete in under 10 minutes each. The characters are relatable and their notifications aren't intrusive. I don't usually spend money on apps, but I went ahead and bought the paid version for a year and it's worth it for the extras. I had the free version but I wanted the unlimited lives, extra lessons, and stories to open without spending coins."", ""I use to really love Duo, it was easy and accommodating so could go at my own pace. Unfortunately it's changed to a weird heart system where after so many chances; you have to WAIT to be able to practice again. This is a huge blow to someone who has disabilities memory and learning. I don't learn this way. If it's a tactic to try and get subscriptions I get it(kinda) but you're really hurting those who Want to learn and don't have the money for that sort of thing. Very disappointed"", ""I like this app. It does teach well, but I think it would be better if duo got rid of hearts. It's annoying having to wait another day just for my refill of hearts and practicing the same lessons to achieve more hearts. Everyone should have the option to practice with unlimited hearts but that's my opinion. Also one more thing that's irritating is the leagues. It's hard because your competing against a bot or duo plus people and it's hard trying to advance xp above them. Its very competitive."", 'Fun, and easy. Just sometimes extremely repetitive. I appreciate the idea this pounds the language into your head, but I feel like true immersion involves a broader use of the language than the same statements over and over and over. It would also be far more enjoyable and less drudgery, to log in and expect to learn something new instead of dreading saying the same 5 things repeatedly.', ""It is fun but I keep getting told that it is not a way to completely learn to be fluent. I am addicted to it. I like congratulating others to keep at it. I both like it and sometimes don't like it when they add changes. I got all the way to the second checkpoint when they determined that the second check point I was at should not be there anymore. It was very upsetting. I also kept the minimum amount for my streak to continue because I'm a mom and have busy distractions."", 'Huge fan. But PLEASE fix the way the program freezes, never to unfreeze. I am having to uninstall and reinstall constantly. This is a fabulous program. I am grateful because I have learned a lot from you. Update -- SIX months have passed. The screen freeze issue remains together with the need to uninstall and reinstall to get it working again.

Also even though my work LinkedIn account is linked to my personal LinkedIn account (via the two different email addresses), if I complete a course with my work LinkedIn Learning account (which I get for free), I can't add a certificate of completion to my personal LinkedIn account, even though they're both linked together."", 'I like that it maintains track of your progress, but it\'s hard to navigate in a video or see quickly where you are if you are looking at the contents screen.

This is a fantastic service to support experts who are willing to take the time out to teach and enrich those who are willing to learn. Thank you for the service!', 'Good, not great. It desperately needs a ""Dark Mode"" option.

Other than that, this app is great.', ""They've included a larger number of courses that were on other learning platforms and rebranded them. The problem is so many are outdated or low quality.

While using cell data, it also unexpectedly pauses, skips, and decides that you\'re done with a lecture while there are still several minutes to go.

Being able to collapse different course titles in the ""Downloads"" view is helpful, and I like having quick access to the PDF course guides. However, this version also took a few steps backwards: 1) Why can\'t we store videos on SD card anymore? Will TGC bring that back or has it been permanently removed? The videos take up a LOT of space and I was running low as it was. 2) Now all videos play with the status bar and button bar permanently visible instead of in full-screen view.

Not a problem but annoying and looks unprofessional.', ""2020-04-16 (revised to 3 stars) The folks at Great Courses Plus are obviously working on improving the user experience and have made a significant progress over the past 2 weeks. The latest version of the app (version 5.2) times out less frequently and hasn't crashed on me yet. Therefore, the original 1 star review is no longer warranted. There is still room for improvement, but kudos to TGC for the progress so far. 2020-04-04 (original review) The 1-star review is for the new release of the Android app and the lack of support for it. First general problems: The app hangs, crashes, and will go into spinner mode until you exit and restart it. This happens multiple times daily. And when it's not doing those things, it can be painfully slow. I suspect much of the slowness is due to a new back-end system implemented by the Great Courses. Things have gotten substantially worse after the upgrade to the new system (when all of the device passwords were reset). Specific bugs: 1) Speaking of passwords, the Android app has a 20 character limit for the password, even though the website will allow you to configure a longer password. There's no warning about this website. I had to figure it out the hard way. 2) The app allows you to download content so you don't have to stream and incur data plan charges. But inexplicably (I think because they never tested this), when you start to play downloaded content while not connected to wi-fi, you get a pop-up warning you that you need to change settings to allow data streaming because you're not connected to wi-fi. But this is the whole point of downloading content. And if you try to exit popup, you have either changed the setting (which I don't want to do - I downloaded the content because I *don't* want to stream over my data plan) or you haven't changed it and playback stops. So I just leave the dialog open and then app eventually crashes once I'm back in wi-fi range. Great... I haven't received a response to any of my recent attempts to contact Customer Service. As a long-time customer of The Teaching Company / The Great Courses (since the time when courses were sent out on cassette tapes) this is disappointing. They used to have very good, responsive customer service. It's a shame because the app and customer service are so bad that I'm ready to cancel."", ""I love the Great Courses, and based upon the content, I was planning on extending past the 30 day trial. However, I'm not sure I will. On my Samsung phone, it pauses every couple of minutes and gets really annoying to keep pressing play. This could be very dangerous for those that try to listen and drive. Also, on my phone, I have to exit the app a couple times in order for my content to appear. The roku app won't keep you signed in so it takes a while to sign in and it's really annoying."", ""The content is great. The app is a little slow and buggy sometimes but that's not a huge deal.

I will start a lecture and listen as I clean the house but invariably playback will stop and I have to pull out my phone, pause, then play again. It also never goes on to the next lecture without me having to do the same. It often stops playing new lectures altogether after two or three. Then I have to actually kill the app and restart it.

It is pretty to look at, but I wish they had put more effort into smooth, reliable operation.', ""Best new feature: you can now download lectures in audio and listen offline. (Before, you could only download video lectures.) The app now marks your place in each lecture, even if you skip between lectures or courses. It now freezes much less often.

However, if I click play from the lock screen, Not only does the course I want to listen to play, but also some random course I was listening too previously also starts playing. It's a little frustrating to have to open the app each time I want to resume my course"", ""I love the courses (selection and content), but the platform is terrible. I stream the courses at home and in my car. If I don't remember to open the app before leaving home, it does not recognize my ID and password when I try to use it in the car. When away from home,, I can't close the app because I have the same problem. Some of the older courses don't have an audio only option which uses more data if you stream them in your car. All the courses should have an audio only option."", ""The app used to be pretty bad and had a difficult to use UI. Also couldn't delete individual downloaded lectures, you had to delete a whole course of downloaded lectures. All these issues are now gone and the app runs much more smoothly now after an update that came out a late last year. Only thing I can think of that needs to change is making all lectures available for audio download, as I think there are still some that are available for video download only."", ""The content is wonderful. The app is not. It rarely remembers where I am in a lecture series, both within a given lecture and where I left off between them. It says that you can save the lectures to your SD card, but you can't. Also, the opening screen should be my watchlist, not some random collections of lectures in which I have no interest."", ""Edit: reduced to 1 star. After more than 2 years and hundreds of hours of lectures, I'm removing the app and canceling my subscription. Audio streaming has been failing to load with increasing frequency over the last year, and has now become entirely non-functional. Same issue on iphone X and Samsung S20+. Verizon, tmobile, wifi, all the same. I have one course to finish in video mode and I'll be canceling my subscription, and it's a real shame."", 'As the others said, the content is great. The lecturers are good, and the topics are many and interesting. The applications (be that on Win 10, Fire or Android) leave a lot to be desired. There is no consistency across the board (which happens when someone hires different contractors to build them without having an overall standard), and unfortunately the android app is just useless in my case because I cannot listen to the lectures, only watch them. Cancelled my subscription after an year.', ""Great content let down by a bad app: * You can download content, but you must be online to access (why bother?). * You cannot download audio only for many lectures, leading to needlessly big downloads/data. * When you download the video and let your screen sleep, the audio stops. * There's no easy way to see where you left off. * Way too much focus on video for what is great audio content. * No Android TV support at all. All in all, there's a lot that feels poorly thought out and woefully executed. The inability to play content offline is absurd. All the major streaming services have that figured out, but here it's a mess. I still kinda recommend the overall product, but the app makes it absolutely painful. It's a mess."", 'Good content. Greatest problem is that you cannot download the audio of a video course. Thus you have to stream it if you are away from wifi; not good if you have a limited data plan. Downloading the video and playing it later would work but for my battery being more quickly depleted by playing the video just to listen, not watch. May quit when my free trial is up.', ""This app has been amazing, there are so many learning opportunities. I've been listening mainly to history lectures as I work from home but there is so much more I'd love to dive deeper into when I have time. There was recently an issue where my subscription was canceled without my input but they helped me sort that out. Something to do with Google play, not the apps fault. Point being, they have always been very helpful to me when I need it."", ""TL;DR Wonderful learning tool if the audio playback worked consistently. App content has been great so far, but it's good I'm on a free trial because the audio playback is buggy. I drive truck so I want to be able to listen to audio in the background, but I often can't get it to start playing... The loading spinner spins and spins, but no audio. If I choose video, it normally starts in ten seconds or so, but then it stops playing when I send the app to background. It's an irritating Catch 22."", 'If you installed the upgrade that was pushed out on 2/12/2020 and are stalled at the sign in screen (just a spinning circle and the words, ""Signing In""), try going first to the ""Browse Courses"" option at the bottom of the screen and then use the sign in button that is available there. That was the only way I could get past the stalled ""Signing In"" screen that came up whenever I tried to sign in directly from the starting screen. Love The Great Courses Plus. Still room for improvements to the mobile app, but they\'re working on it.', ""The content is genuinely top-notch (I'm often quite surprised by the production quality) and had a wide variety of topics to choose from. The app is a little slow and sometimes buggy, but I expect it'll improve in time. Pricing is kind of expensive, but they're making new courses regularly so it doesn't seem like such a waste to me. I'm overall very happy with Wondrium."", ""Fantastic but dated. Catalogue is huge and the speakers well selected. My only complaint, and unfortunately it's a big one, is how dated all these lectures are. The ones I've listened to are all from the 2000's. Much has changed and been discovered since than.

Whenever I hear new words, I write them into a little book I carry around, so I assumed I would have to type everything over again, but NOPE! This saves me so much precious time. And there are different quiz styles, and also a dark mode (some unnecessary fun). Just wish the pro version was cheaper, but of course, I am a cheapskate."", 'This app is amazing!

I use it to study Japanese and it even has features to help you fill in the blank in various languages which helps save some time when creating a study set.

Thank you to whoever made quizlet, you deserve an award."", ""This app is wonderful. I am a pre-nursing student, I am able to put all my vocabulary terms and textbook definitions into Quizlet then use them as either flashcards, a matching game, or test myself. I'm in love. And this is for the free version! That ads aren't obnoxious or anything. I may invest in the paid version just because this is helping me so so much!"", ""Support refuses to acknowledge and fix obvious and intrusive issues, even when made aware of them in very rudimentary terms; so I can't properly utilize the app I pay to use. Can't edit cards during study mode. In edit mode, the card won't expand to accommodate entire term. Cards can't have pictures in term side. Picture terms show up as random sizes in study mode, often way too small. Sets downloaded don't work offline. Cards with pictures won't flip unless tapped on the very edge of the card."", ""I like quizlet because it's really easy to use but I do feel that they need to add more features, for example if you create a set with 500 cards why can't you add a feature that allows us to study select cards from the set, that way we wouldn't have to study the whole thing all at once, give us the choice to study the amount we want that would he awesome."", ""While the app is very helpful, being able to adjust the text placement and size of the text within the app would make it much more user friendly. Not everyone can see the text at the current size. I am using it to learn Thai and it is important to see enough detail to know which letter is which, but that's very hard to do as the app stands now. I would like to increase the text size and be able to choose the text to be centered whenever displayed to maximize use of the screen and legibility."", 'Its great for a free product. I know you can pay for it for added features, but the same thing still happens on your phone. When you run through your flashcards, swiping right or left to see what you know, it does not keep track if you accidentally shut down the application.

Flashcards work well for me to reinforce concepts i get wrong or get confused between. Even the free version of the app is great, and lets u see what others have used as the description for terms. U can add pictures too. And wonderful to have the app to pull up flashcards and concepts as you are studying/ in the hospital to reinforce your learning in the real world. Definitely recommend!', ""If like using it on the computer/browser is still a lot nicer. You can actually do the matching portion of the test, which is the most common type of test that I get where I have to use Quizlet. At least on a browser, you are forgiven if you add a S to the end of a word compared to in the app they'll mark it wrong when it's really not. Overall, not bad! I just wish it didn't cost so much to get Quizlet plus or else I'd totally get it."", ""I started using Quizlet again recently after a small hiatus this past semester. Before, I would have rated Quizlet as 4 stars; there's always room to improve. Now, I want to rate the app as 2.5 stars.

It keeps showing me the definition side when I have it set to show the term. It does the same thing when I reverse the order to be shown first. Also, when I had this on my iPhone, it allowed me to download sets for offline viewing. Now on the android, it does not. Pretty disappointed and will be looking for a different app.', 'Great for learning on-the-go. Some features are different from the website version. (For instance, the asteroid game is not available, the matching game is easier because you tap with your fingers instead of dragging with a mouse, and the tests are given one question at a time with no ability to scroll back up and double check your answers before submitting.) But the most important features are all there and you can connect to your website account.', ""I really like to use this app to study specifically for medical terminology as it involves A LOT of terms to learn and memorize. My complaint is that it seems as if after you get past or close to around 100 terms, it becomes VERY laggy. It takes at least 10 seconds to go from one definition to the next term when typing them in. This causes a lot of frustration because the time that I have to wait for the cursor to go to the next thing adds up. All of my chapters have well over 100 terms each so this is something I have to deal with every single time I have a new chapter. I'm sure this wouldn't happen if I purchase the premium version, but I'm a broke college student that's just trying to study."", ""Cool flash cards, just what I was looking for. I really like the multiple options for how the cards and matching can be presented. Edit 2020-07-23 I like this app a lot, and I'm constantly using it. For now, I'm dropping to 4 stars because performance has been suffering. I'm seeing lots of bugs when rapidly switching between this app and others (like a browser)."", ""I've used Quizlet alot over the years. It's a simple, easy program that makes studying so much better. However, the new update kind of took away most of the cool features and replaced them with ads for a premium option. I didn't really like that because it made using the app harder. I personally have no problem with buying a premium feature, however, I know people who are students and can't really afford to pay for these things monthly."", ""I was confused at first, I usually use quizlet online. I thought that you had to pay for learning mode. I was upset, I downloaded the app and you didn't need to pay for it, it's free. You can pay for it if you want your custom study path. Also upset that when doing the learning mode, I think there should be a FREE option to put images for terms as well, or it can get confusing. That's all! The learning mode is the part that gets me excited the most to study! Having quizlet for 2 years! :)"", ""Quizlet is so helpful for studying vocabulary. Sometimes I make my own study sets but other times I use one that someone else made. I love that if I don't have time to make flashcards, I can start studying immediately and when I do make them, it helps even more when prepping for a test. I'm not particularly thrilled with the new font size. They're huge on my phone. I wish they had a way to control the size so people with impaired vision could have large fonts while others have small fonts."", ""So theoretically, Quizlet itself is a great study tool. Having it on my phone is great, and it's easily worth the money. However as an app, I cannot believe that I'm paying for something that runs soooo slow. I cannot navigate this app at this speed. Sometimes i have to wait over a minute to go from one page to another, and up to 5 minutes for a study set to load so i can even see what's in it. The concept is worth the money. The functionality is not."", ""It's a very useful app for studying or just learning in general. The one issue I think they have though is that the quizlet.live sessions aren't very stable, so there are frequent disconnects while playing with large amounts of people. Other than that I would recommend it to anyone who needs extra practice on a topic or needs to memorize something quickly."", ""I got through high school and college using Quizlet! There is no excuse as to not being able to study... It is as easy as opening Quizlet on your phone. I'm a very visual learner, so the flashcards and vocabulary make it very easy for me. Study at work, in your car, even in the dark when you're about to go to sleep! It's a great way to keep grades up."", ""Life-changing! Love Quizlet! I don't know what I'd do without it. It makes flashcard making so much faster. And, now I don't have to mess with carrying index cards around. Great for anatomy courses, because you can use photos. Developer suggestions: (1) I wish there were a way to select & copy specific cards from one set to another. (2) The mobile app does not allow editing a card while studying the set. (3) You cannot sort the cards alphabetically in editing mode."", 'I love this app, and will be using it for a long time! It makes studying easier. The only thing that could be changed is the folders. I love that we can organize sets by anything, but it can still be messy. A great update would be to allow users to make sections on their folders. For example, if they have a science folder, they could have a section in the folder on a topic or unit, and be able to study that whole section without the other off topic sets. I think this would be great! Thank you!', 'Only one significant short coming after months of heavy use...When using the testing feature, after selecting an answer to a multiple choice question, the displayed answer information is extremely good but it is cleared automatically before it is possible to read it when the questions are complex. There appears to be no way to wait for you to tap or otherwise signal that you are ready to continue. Very aggravating.', 'I wish that there was more that you can do with the free version, but I enjoy the app. I use it for all of my classes. I truly appreciate how organized that you can be with it all. Something that would be nice (unless i missed this option) would be the ability to color code the sets or have a multi color deck to be able the subtopics within a set.', ""I used this thing in the past and did really well with it. But this new version has removed functionality that has made it less effective. I credit previous versions of this for doing really well in my classes. I could study during a long commute because of the Play mode. I could study while rowing or jogging because of play mode. But it seems that the play option is gone. When you're a parent, you need to study when you can. Bring the play mode back! And landscape mode for flashcards!"", ""I'm preparing for my AP Biology class next year and Quizlet has made my life so much easier! I love it! The only complaint I have is on the actual Quizlet website, when I'm trying to study, these ads on the side of my screen are very distracting. I'll close out the ad but then a new one will pop up in less then two minutes. I understand that Quizlet needs to get their money somewhere--since it's a free learning tool--but it does get distracting."", 'I really love the overall simplicity of the application. i just wish that the testing format would allow for a little more room for error. For example I would sometimes use plural wording in my notecards and that would cause me to get a question wrong. Even with this issue though the app allows for you to select when you got a question right despite minor spelling errors so it is a very minor issue.', ""It's perfect for studying!!! I use it all the time for vocab and schoolwork. It's more than just flashcards, it's like having an interactive exposure to knowledge in a convenient and simple way.

I feel bad leaving two stars for a trial of this program, which has clearly had a lot of thought and effort into it, but like many reviews i see on here, it just gets stuck on the paint level and stops progressing.

I have two that weren't showing interest and were struggling with reading. Within a couple weeks, they are interested and excited to read by themselves!

My son and I have games not loading for us. We click on things over & over & certain games still don't load. Then for art, you can't erase the stickers... you can't delete them, you have to close out of the art game completely, and then go all the way back in just so you have a clean slate to do art work & drawing again.

I tried to load it on my desktop but it is not allowed even though the app store says my device is compatible. You can not use it via the internet (no cloud based option).

App is perfectly fine up until the point you agree to the terms of the subscription to the fee, then suddenly it can't find your email, doesn't load or just can't locate your information even though you have a receipt from Google.

By the way I have a Samsung Tab A."", 'There needs to be a confirmation prompt when hitting the back arrow in the upper left hand corner during a lesson.

I create lists myself and have found workarounds, but it's annoying and I wish we could search by reading level only."", 'Love epic but the app has flaws. Having to log in every time you open it is a pain. The pane that pops up to show book progress while you are reading cannot be closed manually.

It is sometimes difficult to find an age appropriate book in a timely manner for your students. I could go on but out of characters.', ""This app is great! I like the variety of books available, though I hope the library continues to expand. The user interface is easy to navigate and I love being able to download for offline reading.

It is a fun and productive way to pass time.', ""We like this app, however, there are issues with it. Sometimes when we save books for offline, they don't save. The app closes and freezes alot. This gets frustrating. We no longer live near a library, so this became a reading option for a family of avid readers. Unfortunately, the app doesn't always function well."", 'I would have given this a 5 star before the last update. But since then, you can no longer turn your phone screen off! You have to leave it on the entire time! In the old version you could turn the screen off & continue to listen. But now my son is concerned about screen burn. He used to listen to them ALL THE TIME!

We have access to 6 different services for our kids to read. Of all of them Epic is the best so we decided to subscribe. It's easy to use and the kids are actually excited to read on Epic. The Android app: It works fine but is missing some key features. No way to download books or audio books for offline usage in the car. Also when playing an audiobook you can't use the phone for navigation."", 'Great app with one area of improvement, being the integration with Google Auto, ie. There is no integration.

You can't listen after turning device screen off. Glitchy. Won't track progress across devices. Sometimes loses place on the same device! Epic, your move."", ""Wonderful app. My daughter loves it. However, I upgraded to Unlimited through Google Play but the upgrade is not reflected in the app. She still can't access what she wants, and it still shows up as Epic Free. I submitted a support request days ago with a copy of the receipt and I haven't heard a word. No one gets back to you. My advice is to stay on the free side until they fix the upgrade issue and until they have the capacity to deal with their support tickets."", ""The best feature of this app by far is the appearance of the digital books, as compared with books on Amazon Freetime, which download slowly, and are hard to read until you double click the paragraphs, which is difficult to get right with a child, etc. Even the digital books on Libby are sometimes frustrating to read. Every book, audiobook, read-to-me books, and videos play seamlessly. The selection is excellent including books in Spanish! I also love that it's free to educators."", ""I LOVE this app. My daughter loves this app. The books are adorable, and there's even some of her favorites.

Not only do students have options for books that can be read to them, they also have access to relevant educational songs and learning videos (which teachers can also disable if they so choose).

I am going to see if there are better options."", 'Fantastic for my son but the activity reporting is bugged. He loves the selection of books although I would love to see the inventory selection grow to include more classic classroom favorites like Robert Munsch. I like that we can see what he is into, and get reports on his activity. The UI design seems appropriate and pretty simple for a child to navigate. The one negative is that the number of books and the time spent reading are added incorrectly, reporting much higher than actual activity.', 'A lot of titles. Some have quizzes. I would recommend the app tag books with quizzes as well as make the reading levels filter more effectively. It does sometimes feel as if I am looking through 40k titles to find the right type of book for my child. Other than that this app is great. Definitely worth the monthly subscription, especially if you have multiple children.', 'Absolutely wonderful app for young readers! It has a wide selection of the best storybooks for children beginning with picture books and on. There are quite a few readers as well...honestly you must check it out to believe it. The illustrations in the books are beautiful and the readers for the Read with Me books and the audiobooks are absolutely excellent! Thanks for such a wonderful app for reading!', ""Love this app! A world of books for kids to read including old favorites and new books you would find on the shelves and in Scholastic. Read to me section is great and let's kids explore on their own even when you can't be there to read to them. I feel confident that when my kids watch the videos available that it is all kid friendly content.Truly wonderful and I reccomend it to all. *Please add a heart to each book on the menu so that we can press to add to favorites without opening the book."", ""Updated review- We were very happy with the app at first, but it has a lot of bugs. Customer service is friendly,and tried to help, but the problems still persist. The app uses your 2 hours of after school time even though it says you have switched over to school time and then doesn't work for the week. Now it's not recording what books we have already read. Great concept, but needs a bit of work."", ""My child and I enjoy this app a lot! Lots of things to do and lots of books! The only thing I don't like about it has to do with the books that read to you. When the page turns, the voice that's reading will say the first word of the next page, but then it'll cut out. Once the page is turned it repeats the word again. It's annoying because it breaks up the book flow. Can this be fixed? At first I thought I had something wrong on my side, but a few of my friends had mentioned the same thing."", ""Great app but doesn't work normally , whenever you finish a book it doesn't count, sometimes you'd be at 105 books read and wouldn't get the badge for it. For some characters and patterns you can't tell how to get it unless you're on computer and we're usually on ipad. Overall great app! Sometimes people get competitive about who's the highest level which is okay! A(nd not the apps fault.)"", ""I wish this app would work for us, I installed it for my kids 3 year old and 5 year old. Both are learning to read, and could not read on their own yet. The problem is, this app shows all sorts of books, and doesn't label the books according to their appropriate age category. I don't see any option for filtering the books according to age, level of difficulty, or level of reading proficiency. So finding an appropriate book to read for my preschooler is a hit and miss. Also, the read to me option is not interactive at all, its like watching a video, not a reading experience. I want my kids to be able to read along, ie they should be able to follow the reader verbatim, and then flip the page at their own pace. I guess this app is not so suitable for early readers (pre-K or grade K)."", ""They must be about to shut this app down. There is no other reason for the rapid decline of this service. When we first signed up ~ 1 year ago, it was good. All books were good & age-appropriate for my 4 yo. She liked the badges & seeing the progress bar really motivated her to keep reading. Now it's a real piece. Most of the time it gets stuck on the loading screen, she's capped out at level 23. Progress bar is grayed out & there are no more badges to earn. Thereare no quality books anymore."", ""Epic app never works! On tablet or phone it forces you to download the app. Once downloaded it is sooooooo slow that it crashes every time. If you try through the browser you can't go beyond the screen to download the app. If you try to log-in off school hours on your laptop, I get stuck having to choose from 2 paid plans. Epic free doesn't seem to be available anymore even though they said it's available. I am so disappointed with this company. Thanks for wasting our time."", ""Love it!! I am a mother and all 4 of my kids use it. It's awesome that some of 4he hooks are read to you and the words are highlighted. It helps so much with my little ones and it has other books that you can read on your own. My kids use it when we are in the car and they just go from book to book. The app is easy to use for any kid and it's just a great amount of book options for many age groups."", 'Incredible way for my kids to enjoy reading and learning on the go no matter what we are doing they can read or be read to. They enjoy searching through the videos to watch something new. And most importantly I know they are safe with what they are reading/watching. They now easily read more then an hour a day. Not including listening to or reading stories while driving, brushing teeth, or while we are out and about shopping. We love the human voices and the dialogue is fun to listen too.', ""Looks cool. BUT if you choose the free version there is a time ‚è∞ limit that I blew through just scanning books to see what they have!

Ugh so annoying!!!"", ""This app is amazing. My daughter is finishing kindergarten and its perfect for helping her read. She can try on her own, the app can read it to her while magnifying the word that it's speaking or of course I can read it with her. Some books have quizzes at the end while everything gives you points towards a level and unlocking achievement badges. On a galaxy s10 or even the desktop website, it's very user friendly. After school ends I will definitely be signing up again."", 'My child is enjoying all of the books and features of this app. I also like that some of the books we have at home can also be found on epic. The only thing that I would like changed is to have a bigger font size of the text to some of the ""read to me"" books from my phone app - it\'s way too small for me to read (and I have a large screen) so my child can\'t follow the words when it reads to him and he can\'t try to read it himself to practice.', 'Update: App opens to blank screen alot. We are also finding books that are inappropriate as well as not quality.

When my library account was suspended for non renewal, I tried this app. The books are well formatted to ebook use and there is a great selection.', ""I like epic but some of the books don't have a play button on them. For the audio books my daughter and I like to read. So therefore we are unable to read them and that is very disappointing bc some books I really want to read and it happens alot please fix. Also it skips pages when reading books and won't let us go back and some times kicks us off completely and I have to log back in other than that I like it but I do ask that you can fix the glitches please."", ""This is the app that helped my daughter to learn how to read, she loves it! She reads everyday from the largest variety of books it has. We discover the app when she was in 2nd grade and we'll keep it for many years. It also has books in Spanish which is a plus!! Every time you connect it shows you books according to your reading level, and it allows you to save books to read later when you're offline. It also allow you to connect your account with epic school and track her performance."", ""This app is absolutely great for sharing the classics I used to read when I was growing up, and I can also find a vast amount of new, award winning, and age appropriate tittles for me to share with my 6 year old daughter. This app has been a life saver in the grocery store and on long car rides because of the ability to have a narrator read the books if I'm not able to at any moment. Very glad we have downloaded this app onto all of my family's devices! Well worth the subscription fee!"", ""I have been using Epic for over a year and greatly enjoyed using it with my granddaughter and some others that I tutor. I pay monthly. This month, I started seeing books that say they are only available with an Unlimited account. I attempted to Upgrade to this Unlimited version even though I was frustrated that they started this and never contacted their subscribers. I sent two emails through their Support system and have heard nothing from them. If it's technical difficulties, please say so."", 'My son loves this app! His teacher recommend during quarentine/homeschool. He loves to read now! My son is 5 and autistic. He learns better with Auditory learning then visual learning! Epic gives you that! But still includes visual learning! The app uses visual ques by highlighting the word when the person reading the story aloud on the select read to me books! It also features books on different reading levels, so the he continues to grow. There are audio books & awards to earn for reading too!', ""This app doesn't remember the place in audiobooks where you left off. I need to write down timestamp every time I switch off the phone & then manually find it, takes forever! Also you need to have all open with screen unlocked! App cannot play audiobook with screen off. And I am a paid subscriber! This app definitely needs serious improvement"", ""Good app. Could be made better by allowing audio books to be listened to with the screen off.

I wish prodigy would go back to the way it was when it first came out."", ""I really love Prodigy, I really do! But, I just HATE the fact that we have to be a member to evolve pets, and climb the Dark Tower. Also, can you at least make the rescue pet option for free after wasting other pets on it?

I understand you need to make money, but, if you want to have more people playing your game, make it fun and free!"", ""Its good, but it is not the best it could be. There should be ways to have free membership. If I'm battling a member at even a lower level they beat me by a lot. I feel that member stars shouldn't be a thing and that a lot more items and evolving available for everyone . The multiple currencies is very confusing. Could there be currency exchanges? The arena is confusing and the top 10,000 should get the pets. Beyond that its a game that I never get bored at. There's always something going on!"", ""Although the game is fun because you can collect items, make friends, battle other people, and own a house, it is really agitating when I am doing the dark tower. The game crashes when I am in the middle of battling. In order for the dark tower to save where you are, you must be on a level that ends with '1' or '6'. And when you crash, you have to start at the previous saved level. I find this really inconvenient because I only have membership for a few days and I want to reach level 100."", 'Really cool game! It makes learning a little more fun. My son, who\'s in another state, and I play together and do ""battles"" together. And even at 34, I\'ve actually improved at math since playing with him lol.

Great idea but poor order of questions.', ""It's a good game as a whole, but the fact that you need a membership to merely evolve the pets is frustrating. after every fight it asks you to evolve them when you can't! It's aggravating because that can be implemented into the non-members' games without any issues and less complaints."", ""It so fun! I used to hate the thought of math, so I failed. Then when our teacher introduced us to this I started to like math. This makes learning math fun. All the items you can earn, and the pets/companions you can earn.

Finally, the results seen in the students' understanding and enjoyment of math has been phenomenal."", 'Great and not. My kids have a lot of fun with this! However my sons game constantly crashes which is very frustrating so he has to start missions over. The reminder of not having a membership is crazy. No upgrading or evolving without it sadly.

Fix the crashing and constant not a member reminder and its great.', ""I love this game. It's fun and educational. The storyline is neat too! But I think you've gone a bit too far with the membership. It seems as if you need the membership to do almost ANYTHING. And I think it would be better as a one purchase the and NOT a trial. But I do have one question, are there ANY differences between downloading the game and just playing it in the internet? Kind of a waste of storage if you ask me. Other than the membership, the game is pretty good."", 'Ok, so I started playing back in 2017. And I could evolve pets, climb the tower, and the characters looked better. I came back in 2021 and I can\'t even evolve my pets anymore! The characters now look different than they did like 4 years ago, but some of my accessories now say ""Members Only"".

Price: Memberships do not need to be so expensive. Period. Member stars/boxes, the dab, clouds, and special houses: These are almost entirely useless and I don't care what you do with them. Member stars and boxes just shouldn't exist at all. Things everyone should have: 1st: EVOLUTION. I have been playing prodigy for 4 years and have never gotten a Frostfang. This is infuriating because I have a high level Articlaw, plenty of money, and have most definitely seen a Frostfang before (It was in a battle with a member). If you change anything, Please let non-members evolve their pets! This is important! 2nd: Member-only purchases. Besides evolution, this is one of the best features at driving me up a wall. 3rd: Medium and large houses. I mean really, you save up for a decently-sized house and then you can't buy it because you're not a member. Something else: When you buy a pet, it should be the same level as you or at least the monsters you fight. Whenever I buy a pet, it starts at level 1. I have been saving up for the 2,000 shiver Frostfang since shivers existed, and would appreciate it if you fix this soon.

And now that they've added long, obnoxiously loud advertisements between every review, It's just not worth downloading. Uninstalling today after the latest ad update."", ""I've been using this app for nearly 7 years.It has helped me memorize so many words and I like the way the app looks. Having a leaderboard/scoreboard really helps motivate me to study. I can't stop using it! It would be great if the difficult words wasn't part of Memrise Pro. It would also be nice if my keyboard automatically appeared when doing the tapping test as it use to years ago. 11.26.2021 Now has full-page ads. (was 4-stars)"", 'I am enjoying learning with this app. The words and phrases are repeated frequently enough with words I just learned that it keeps wverything fresh. I can record myself speaking the words and phrases I learn. I can also listen to different people saying the words I am learning, and at different speeds. This helps me figure out what is being said easier. This is fun!', 'I am using it for French, and can comment on that language only. I have been enjoying it the most of any language learning app so far! I am using it along with Duolingo, and I also use the Toucan extension on my laptop. I would recommend this combination. Especially if you only wanted to pay for one program, get this one and use the free versions of Toucan and Duolingo. Nothing can replace classes with a native speaker, but for learning a language in just minutes a day this combination works.', ""This app is completely unusable unless you buy the paid version. Sure, it's free to download but it's not free to use. There's no point in downloading it if you already have a paid program you're using and you're just looking for some free supplementation, which is my case. This app really shouldn't be advertised as free since it's completely unusable without paying."", ""I really enjoy this app! I feel motivated, and I am learning with an app without dropping or just giving up for the first time! It's incredibly engaging! I definitely recommend this app! (I'm a native Spanish speaker, a certified English Teacher, and a Medical Interpreter.) My question is: Can I (or could you please add this feature?) change the app's interface language from English to Spanish? It would make my learning experience even smoother! Thank you!"", 'Great app! I have this and Busuu to accompany my Textbooks, in learning Japanese. I love how this app has real native speaker clips, with a variety of accents and voice types saying the terms. I also really love the pronunciation practice feature. This is the most true to native modern Japanese learning program I found, that is not just formal Japanese, but a good mix with real context and great content! Would definitely recommend!', ""I've only used this app for a few days but I really like it so far. It includes words and phrases that I haven't seen in other apps (for casual conversation) and I really like the videos of native speakers. Some of the native speakers are hard for me to understand but I'm expectinging this will get my ears attuned to the way native speakers talk."", ""This was a good app when you had the option of learning a language for free, albeit far more slowly than the paid version. Now you get a couple of lessons to get your feet wet, so to speak. Really? You might as well take away those joke lessons entirely; it's utterly pointless. I left Memrise for Duolingo."", ""I bought the Black Friday lifetime deal and am thrilled. I've used this for years and I love where it has ended up. I have Speaktribe, Speakly, Mondly, Duolingo, Clozemaster, Busuu, Beelingua, Quizlet, Lingua, etc. Memrise and Quizlet are my two favorite, most used, most useful language apps in conjunction with Duolingo. Sometimes the simplest is the best. The UI is good for RSI or people who have hand disabilities or simply don't like too much clicking. It autoadvances and is flexible about answering. I love it."", ""Great app. I feel it's much better than the free ones and a lot cheaper than most pay-to-use ones. I do this alongside the free version of Duo-lingo and feel I'm getting a really great grasp on Castillian Spanish. I'm not sure why one poster said you pay for each lesson. I paid a fairly modest one-time fee for the year, and it comes down to less than $0.25 per lesson...avout a quarter of that if you do review lessons over an over again, as I do."", ""Update: Very sad to see that I have to pay for a ton of options that used to be free to users. I've been on the app for over 4 years and enjoyed how much I have been learning, but now I have to move on to something that I can have the full experience of :( Old rating: 5‚≠êI do miss the old layout with the pretty colors and rocket ships.

And random words that my books or teacher may not normally think to include (looking at you- bald head in Korean 2). The reason for the mediocre star rating? A recent update has changed so that in between sets of practice I get full page ads that include sound/video. I really don't want to see male hormone commercials when trying to study."", 'Fun and super helpful app! Only improvements I would like to see are that every course has all options available when paying for premium (listening with locals, etc are sometimes only on certain courses), and that it was easier to search for non languages courses /to make your own course from the app (instead of the desktop page) like it used to be. Otherwise, though, an awesome learning app for languages and/so/ much more!', ""This app is fine but incredibly poorly supported for a paid version. For some reason my username and password stopped working. I requested to reset my password. The app stated an email was sent. No email has been received. Checked spam, etc. When I signed up for my pro account it took two or three weeks to hear back from customer service. I suspect the same thing will happen now since I've never received a password reset email."", ""I'm doing the Spanish training and I like it. There's enough repetition in every format to help me learn but not so much that it becomes tedious. I like that you can hear it said by native speakers in a real world setting. I took Spanish for two years in school but couldn't actually apply it in the real world, so I forgot most of it. This app is really good at teach practical words and phrases you'll actually use in real life."", ""I'm trying to become fluent in French so I've been using several different resources. This one is unique because it really exposes you to the different ways people may speak one language. I'm not a beginner in French and started in French II, but I went back to French I to learn more common phrases. No one resource will teach you a language, but this one is incredibly useful for listening and conversational skills."", ""I've had a subscription for two years now, but haven't been using the app much. I finally decided to jump back in and the new theme was a huge shock. Very loud colors on all white, in stark contrast to the old, relaxing space theme. Even the animations are more jarring, much less smooth than before. I want to say that I could get past this, but, going through the lessons is no longer enjoyable, so I may have to go back to Duolingo. An option to choose themes (or revert versiona) would be great!"", 'I liked the app itself and am a subscriber. That said, the redesign is really bad. It might be fashionable, but it distracts from the learning process, it makes it hard to read the text, and it makes precious seconds in timed tasks get lost in trying to visually parse design elements. It is not good when your UI undermines the very reason your application is there. If I just tried MemRise out for the first time, I would not have stuck with it.', ""The introduction to Japanese was amazingly clear and organized, they removed a lot of user created lessons though which I think was due to the lack of organization in them. Other than that, the price is a little steep if you don't catch a special offer, but if the lessons went even further and more in depth than a brushing of the surface that I've experienced, it might be considerable. If you're looking for a full immersion, you might as well pay full price for a legit course instead of an app."", 'While the learning function is excellent, I\'m changing my review from 5 to 2 stars because the new design is absolutley terrible. It\'s a huge step backwards from its previous charming spaceship theme that made the journey of learning languages feel so fun. The new design looks like a boring app that tried to be cool with the kids. If the intention was to be more ""grown-up"", it has failed spectacularly. At least make it so that the users have the option of switching back to the ""classic"" design.', ""App says it's free, but not even close. It only gives a very short intro to courses. my thing is, why am I going to pay ($30 BUT IT'S ONLY GOOD FOR TODAY!) however much it's supposed to go up to a year when I can't even preview the premium services? even one or two examples of each would make the sale. There is plenty of competition out there. uninstalled."", ""I really like the app, and although I'm not a huge fan of the all the design changes, I'm sure I'll get used to it. But, the new screen for introducing words/phrase for the 1st time is terrible. It's such a big change from the last layout that I no longer properly take note of the words because its a not consistent with the layouts of subsequent pages. My eyes now have to hunt for the translation of the word. As someone who's been using the app a lot, this is almost a breaking change. Please fix"", ""Like other reviewers I'm sorry to be finally writing a review like this after cancelling my subscription.  I used to really like Memrise as a handy and fun learning toll to keep my brain active by learning some Japanese and Spanish. It looked nice and I liked the space theme and calming blue colours. There were some things I'd have liked to see improved, e.g. more grammar, a list of all the content for a course instead of just each module, the ability to make your own modules from the words in the course rather than just flag difficult words, the ability to adjust the speed of the timed questions and time to review the response to your answer before it disappeared. But it was good. The new update is (a) hideous, and (b) broken. The black and yellow theme is awful and subconsciously aversive (like wasps). Some of the content is also now broken: you cannot scroll down the video on my phone to reach the letters you need to answer the question, which was not a problem before, so I just have to skip it! Some videos/questions also just don't load at all!  And it's going up in price?! No thank you."", 'As of now, I can only rate the free version. I am considering buying the yearly subscription, in part because of the good price ($3ish per month) but also because the app functions well, is easy to navigate, and the coursework is presented in a way that is easier (for me, anyway) to remember and use. Hearing AND seeing the native speakers has also been very helpful.', ""Pretty great overall as a learning platform, definitely one of the best if you go PRO. The free version will limit the level to which you learn a course, which is frustrating if you are trying to use this as a teacher with a classroom. Creating new courses still feels a bit primitive, but isn't too hard. One thing I would like to see change is the ability to browse and select courses in the app. Currently there is only a list of languages to choose from, and you need to visit the webpage to search through all subjects."", ""Was surprised to see any negative reviews about this app. I love Memrise and have subscribed for almost a year. Perfect for anyone that learns through memorization and repitition. I'll get on the treadmill at the gym and practice my Korean, the layout is so easy to use and you can turn sound off and still study. The new look really doesn't make a difference to me, still cute space stuff which is nice. I love the locals study, really fun and helpful to hear locals speak. Keep up the good work!"", ""I don't get the high rating. The layout is poorly designed and you're bombarded with offers to upgrade. Because of the design, its difficult to even figure out how to continue for free past three words/phrases. Maybe that's on purpose. Then about a dozen words/phrases in, the on screenini keyboard wouldnt accept any typing anymore to type the answer, so it's stuck. Thats a bug, I assume. I think I could do better learning from websites."", ""When you take away the new look Memrise is an awesome app for language learning. Being able the amount each lesson is extremely helpful if you're feeling overwhelmed. Enjoying features like the Locals, and being able to focus on difficult words or pronunciation. However, like I've seen already, the new look is a big turnoff for most people. Personally, it's too white and the green doesn't fit wherever you put it. Maybe try putting in a dark theme, that works well. Also change the flowers, yuck."", 'pretty good learning app. I also pair it with duolingo and switch off when I start getting annoyed/bored. Also, the dude they found for the beginner level of Japanese is just absolutely incredible. I laugh everything, which coincidentally makes it more memorable. Be warned that sometimes the audio quality will vary between people on ""learn with locals"" and it can be difficult to pick up on if you don\'t already have a basic understanding of the language structure in the first place.', ""The material seems good, but it's not user friendly. I'm having a very hard time following the menus and understanding how the lessons progress and what needs to be done or redone to advance. It's very busy visually and lacks organization and clarity. Duolingo is waaay more user friendly and organized. Too bad Memrise is so hard to follow because it sounds like it's better for building vocab. Unfortunately I'm too frazzled by the disorganization, so I won't likely be using it."", 'Currently the only issues I\'m having with this app is not being able to replay audio in the planting memories portion (it plays after I\'ve ""Continued"" tho). Also, when given three audio options to choose from, only one option actually plays an audio file. My partner also has these issues. Otherwise, love the app. I\'ve used Memrise for several years and have never been disappointed. The new look isn\'t my favorite but its not bad.', 'I was on vacation in Mexico talking to a drunk lady, when our mutual waiter walked up, and she started speaking fluent Spanish. She said she learned mostly on this app, and since downloading it, I have progressed greatly! Highly recommend. My only complaint, is that when you do the little word quizzes, I would like to be able to click on the false words and find out their definition. I think that would be more helpful than focusing only on the 7 or so words in each lesson.']","['com.languagedrops.drops.international', 'air.com.rosettastone.mobile.CoursePlayer', 'com.busuu.android.enc', 'com.atistudios.mondly.languages', 'com.babbel.mobile.android.en']",https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.memrise.android.memrisecompanion&hl=en&gl=us

This is frustrating, especially when even an adult can't hear it and then she spells it wrong WITH help! Often the beginning or ending consonant is so soft that it cannot be heard at all, even with the volume up to maximum. The volume level also fluctuates a bit from activity to activity. We have been using this for a few weeks and have seen progress already. Will keep using, but hope the pronunciation improves."", ""My daughter loves reading eggs, math seeds and fast phonics. Reading eggs has helped her immensely to learn to read and with the addition of fast phonics, it has helped her to improve her pronunciation. The biggest problem I have is with the app itself. After she completes a lesson it sometimes freezes, especially in reading eggs. The only way I've found to fix it is by shutting down the app and restarting it which is frustrating when my daughter is in the middle of something and has to start over. Some of the lessons are a bit repetitive but she hasn't seemed to mind. If the developer could fix the issue with the app freezing up then you would get 5 stars from me."", ""Although I thought the educational content of this game was great, it requires too much manual dexterity. This, not the instruction, was the source of my child's frustration. Many of the interaction points were extremely small. A lot of the time, this was clearly an intentional design choice. There was a ton of blank space on the screen, so the designers could have easily made buttons larger. Maybe this game is okay on s tablet, but it is unusable for a small child on a phone."", ""I have only experienced a few times when it freezes or doesn't keep a child's records of what they have done. The worst part is actually being told they are willing to help by phone... they don't answer and can't leave a message. Live chat... no one is ever there. Or e-mail... which problems can not be fixed by. It is disappointing when you really think highly of an app (with the freezes and all) but have poor experience with customer service."", ""It's a great learning app BUT it constantly crashes and is super slow to load between each activity. My son and I get frustrated with the strikes out when getting things wrong. Ex. Picking the letter on the board. Three strikes for the double activity. He gets through the first with maybe a strike because he accidentally hit the wrong letter. On to the second part, gets one wrong or accidentally bumps wrong letter....you have to start the WHOLE activity over. He gets frustrated and quits."", ""Okay So the app is excellent for learning, but the app consistently freezes and closes at any giving time, also the new feature Fast Phonics doesn't work it keeps freezing my daughter only got to level two with no luck in moving pass because it keeps freezing. I would rate the app 5+ if the app worked properly, please fix this issue so our children can learn without interruptions thanks! Other then those issues my daughter loves learning loves this app highly recommend it!"", 'My kids love this app! The program has helped my daughter profoundly with her reading. The way it is set up works great for kids who need interactive game style learning. I do get some resistance with the games that are more repetitive. Also, I do experience glitches occasionally where it freezes, sticks on a certain scene (the congrats screen or a game) or just loads & loads & loads.', 'I had to change my review. This is a fantastic app. Please try it. My son has learned a lot of math with it. The reading eggs are good. The storylines are great. I wish the 7-13 reading comprehension portion was better. But it is definitely worth for pre K to 2nd grade. After that the stories get a little boring and the graphics need work. I would definitely recommend for new readers. The mathseeds is my favorite. They really asses the child and he can make his own progress.', 'My kids love the math seeds! My 6 yr old struggled in math. When we started this he wanted nothing to do with it. He was frustrated. But once he got started, he realized how easy it was to navigate and that he was progressing and understood it. I 100% recommend this app. We also love the reading and phonics! It makes learning fun!!!', ""Garbage quality app. Brilliant learning style, but the implementation is beyond a joke. Sound drops constantly making certain lessons unsolvable and very frustrating for the kids who then guess and get things wrong. Logins are complete lottery , with constant failure to login (timeouts ) likely due to server capacity. When it works it's great, but most of the time it's well below expectations despite being a mandated school requirement"", ""One can see a lot of work has gone into this app. People who know properly how to teach reading developed the concept. My daughter really enjoys collecting the eggs by doing the exercises, which are funny and divers. I can also see that her reading has improved. What I don't like are all the distractions within the app. Yes, some games and fun in between are fine. But I think a bit less of this would have been better."", ""This is a great app. The activities are diverse and based on strong literacy learning principles. My 5-year-old loves it, and he recognizes that it is helping him learn. It also helps him control impulses as he has to listen or think before clicking (well, he's working on it).We have to close it and restart it a lot. I still really recommend it. Update - had to remove two stars because of glitches that make it difficult to use. Curriculum is great, program has problems."", ""I would give it 5 stars if it didn't keep freezing and crashing all the time! My son is 2 and I decided to introduce him to an app to stimulate his mind. He always asks to play on it but it always freezes and gets stuck on the loading screen and I have to keep logging out and back in again. I'm only on the free trial at the minute so won't be paying for it if its going to keep freezing and crashing all the time."", 'Great app but freezes alot which is frustrating for my 7 year old daughter. The app freezes so we have to keep closing the app to move into the next lesson. My daughter loses interest as it happens a few times during her Reading Eggs sessions. If the issue is sorted, it would be incredible, she would be able to focus and concentrate more on her lessons. Otherwise a great app for learning.', ""My almost 4 year old begs to use this every day. He has come on leaps and bounds, he genuinely enjoys the challenges and gets so excited when it's time for a new egg to hatch, a quiz, a new certificate. Our only issue is that some of the cut scenes freeze his tablet and we have to close and re-enter the app to carry on, it only adds maybe 20 seconds when it happens but it's a nuisance. But that may be down to the tablet rather than the app. Overall, a firm favourite that I'm happy to pay for!"", ""The game is a fabulous program of reading and math. But the free version is full of bugs, constantly freezes itself and my phone. Very frustrating for my 4 year old and me! That's why 2 stars. UPDATE : I got a free trial option so reinstalled it. I click play on FAST PHONICS, choose the level, then a blue screen appears and doesnt go away. I have to shut the game and restart. My tech specs are fine. I was considering buying the mthly subscription but am hesitant now."", ""I would love to give a higher rating however the constant freezing is ridiculous. I've contacted support but instead of admitting the app has issues they told me the tablet probably didn't meet specifications. I had confirmed that it was well within all specifications before even contacting support. The program is wonderful but we have barely been able to use it recently. We have the most recent update yet it still froze 6 times in 10 minutes. Please do something about this."", ""Signed up originally for the 30 day free trial. It is a good tool, albeit a little too repetitive. However as the many other reviews have also said, it constantly freezes! You have to shut it down and reopen and hope you haven't lost your level progress!! We have access on several up-to-date devices with stable internet connection and the issue continues. For the premium subscription I'd expect better to be honest. Will be cancelling at the end of the free trial unfortunately due to this."", ""Some of the content is great, if you can get to it. The navigation is awful - it's unclear what all the different categories represent, and everything takes AGES to load. Also, every time we try to get to the lessons my daughter has to retake the placement test. We've tried the same test three times this week, and it's very long and INCREDIBLY boring. Presumably this is a bug, but there's about 30 questions, and they're way beyond a six year old's capability - it's upsetting for her"", ""Really like the idea of this app but it is unusable in it's current form with the constant freezing so we will not be subscribing. Hopefully the developers are addressing the issues as the actual program is great, just doesn't work technically. Have checked tech specs and we are way above minimum requirements, there are definitely bugs in the software."", ""I really like the content of this app and it holds my 3 year old's attention for a long time. She learns lots from it as evidenced by her reading outside the app. It is quite buggy though with frequent crashes and glitches and impossible to get through to support. I also think I places it is too sensitive. We work through lessons together but often, especially with the books, if you touch the screen by mistake to point to a letter it registers a wrong answer or it flips the page. Annoying."", ""Reading eggs is a great program and is working well for my daughter but the app has a few problems. The volume is inconsistent so you have to adjust it frequently. The app lags in some activities and freezes at the end of others so you have to restart it a few times each lesson. I'm hoping these issues will be fixed."", ""Highly recommended! Living in a non-English speaking country and struggling with sending the kids to after school English lessons, ReadingEggs is a lifesaver. All my kids love it - (ages 5-9). It's a fantastic program and at every turn keeps on surprising with new features. Only confusion was we thought in the beginning that it had to be an app on an android/ios device and we weren't that thrilled about it but turned out that it doesn't have to be! We find it much much easier to use on PC and we love it!"", 'The program itself is great and my 6 year old and 3 year old both love it. I am currently on the trail version and think we will be doing the monthly subscription, however the app constantly freezes, showing a big black screen while the audio continues. Our device meets the specifications so I have no clue why this happens. Both on the app and the website (yes, while using the latest version of chrome). Please fix ASAP. I also think the app title should have mathseeds in it.', ""Both my 5 year old and my 6 year old love Maths Seeds, Fast Phonics and Reading Eggs. Some of the games can drag on a bit and these lose interest (I realise the importance of repetition but sometimes it's a fine line between that and boredom) but, for the most part, this is an excellent resource. Definitely the best one we've tried and we've subscribed for another year without hesitation."", ""The app itself is fantastic and I can't recommed it enough to help phonic and reading development. My little one really struggled until we signed up and since then, has complete soared through and doesnt grimmace at the sight of words. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because of the constant freezing and crashing recently, which has started to put my little one off using it."", ""Great when it works, but as more people seem to be finding, it just doesn't work very well once you get out of Reading Eggs Junior. It's a technically undemanding app, but crashes and hangs all the time. As a piece of advice re customer service, perhaps take some time to look at your coding instead of blaming the power of people's devices (of which ours meets the requirements). There are problems with the app, take that onboard before it really starts to impact your business."", 'As a mother of a 5 year old and a 3 year old, and as an English teacher, I cannot recommend this app highly enough. We have steered clear of apps and tablets for our girls, however when I discovered this app, and after a successful free trial, we allow both of them set time with supervision, and both are excelling in their literacy skills. Our 3 year old is sounding out, blending, knowing words by sight (rapidly catching up with her sister who is in school), and both girls really enjoy the app.', ""My child literally LOVES Reading Eggs. She was looking for something to get her reading / spelling skills up, so I looked into this. Me, being a responsible parent, downloaded it for her to try for some days. She enjoyed it, so I started to pay the $15 each month. Her favourite part is learning, and MY favourite part is.. THERE'S NO ADS! No distractions from my child learning. Great app, keep it up."", ""It's a great app and my kids are showing some good learning developments. One little annoying thing though : volume level fluctuates a lot. i.e. lessons start with low voice and go up suddenly. First 10-20 seconds of the lessons are usually quieter. This need a constant controlling of the device volume. Would be great if you could fix it"", ""It's a good app, however I'm experiencing the same issues that another reviewer has mentioned. The app crashes a lot, and freezes on between learning activities. Some times you can here the audio instruction playing but the screen has not moved on the the correct page. It freezes at the end of certain tasks. It is not my device or internet connection that is causing this. I have to go to setting and close the app every time it cracked and restart the app."", ""I found the app is missing allot of vital stuff. My number one is when the child gets something wrong you just play a sound , so it doesn't show what they did wrong instead of 'if the child has to choose mmm and they choose the letter c you need to play the phonics so they know the difference instead of a sound. If that makes sense, it just small buts that makes a whole lot of difference and turns a mistake into a sort of subliminal learning."", ""Just finished a 30 day trial. My 2.5 year old loves the games and was able to work out how to do most of them with a little guidance. I am not entirely happy with our experience however as the app would frequently freeze meaning we need to close it down and start fresh. Sometimes losing progress in a game. I don't believe it's worth the monthly fee with its current issues and so will not be subscribing."", ""This has been excellent for my son who I'm home-schooling. Loads to do on there and I love the progress report and emails on what he has achieved and what he needs work with. Also the print off bonus material is so helpful. It does take some time to get the hang but worth it!"", ""Daughters really love this and always want to go on it which is great as they are learning so many reading skills without knowing! :) But there are a few letter sounds pronounced incorrect which isnt helpful i.e they pronounce the P grapheme 'puh'. Also my youngest cant do it by herself yet as you can only get three goes wrong before having to start again. It would be good if there was an easier setting for her (she's 3). Another thing we find is the books are read out by the man way too fast!"", ""The site is cumbersome, uninspired and the graphics are BORING! (This is coming from a person that misses the old atari games - I'm not fussy with graphics lol) We had to skip exercises because it was difficult to navigate and the volume was either woeful or blasting None of my 3 kids learned to read from it, they enjoyed it mostly but I bought it to teach them, not as a game. The site needs to be updated instead of milked for profit. There are far better programs out there"", 'Fantastic learning through play app for phonics and reading.

No issues on Andriod mobile device and iPad.', 'Absolutely brilliant program. I saw my daughter at the age of 4, reading better than kids that are 7 or 8.

This is ridiculous, as well as they want you to pay for the full year up front. The original payment plan was just fine, why you guys changed it is beyond me. Very upset and disappointed in your app.', ""I used to love Skillshare. They had great creative classes and great instructors who are working in their industry. Unfortunately, their pricing structure has changed and requires an annual membership. I would love to be a loyal monthly customer or if they base their subscription on a 1, 3, or 6 month period. There are just long periods where I get super busy and can't take classes. I think as a business they are leaving a lot of potential customers out of the table."", ""I enjoy the classes but the app is a bit annoying. Sometimes lessons won't play until I force closd anc restart the app. Screen rotation is unpredictable. Downloads don't warn if K run out of space, they just quit playing already downloaded courses. No way to selectively delete individual lessons without removing the entire course. Still, I am finding lots of useful classes in my area of interest and feel the subscription is a great value."", ""The courses are good. But I think it would be beneficial to add that notification media control features. That way we don't have to open the app to fast forward or pause. Also, it would be good if you made it compatible with Android Wear. It's easy to look at the watch and just click pause. Other than that, the courses are good, but you're missing out on a pretty awesome opportunity here."", 'Great classes but I was charged twice for a one year account. When I contacted them the resolution was to cancel my account but not to refund any of the money. I just wanted to be refunded one of the yearly subscription charges, who wants to get double charged? The classes are wonderful, but with customer service like I have been shown i am not sure the classes are worth the risk to be overcharged for and then canceled while still deducting a monthly fee for the past 3 months.', ""I used to love skillshare. However with their new yearly pricing model I am afraid I have to abandon them as a service. It would be nice to be in control of how I pay. Furthermore their subtitles and how well the app responds, quite slowly, has become frustrating. It's too bad."", ""The app works well and the option to speed up playback is definitely helpful. I just wish you could browse other video titles while listening/watching current content. I know that's one of the things discouraged in most of the improve productivity videos I've watched but I it would still be nice to have. Other than that, no real complaints"", ""Hi, I've used skillshare for awhile now, I love it and what it does. I just have one thing that bothers me. Subtitles, I personally watch most things with subtitles these days. But the specifically with a learning app it's so important to have accurate subtitles! I hope that soon all of the videos can be checked for quality for those subtitles! For me and others who really need it!"", 'I\'ve always loved SkillShare. Tried it a couple of years ago and tried it again recently. Wish there were more certification courses (example would be for the work force field) or maybe more options for personalization & interaction with Teachers -maybe even try implementing something like ""Skillshare Live"" classes? I think that would pull in a lot of interested clients. I know that a ""LIVE"" class option without a doubt would be something I would pursue both as a student AND a teacher.', ""I joined seeking fictional writing courses but they're all basic levels to the point of feeling like I'm in 7th grade. I also thought there would be higher quality than being shot on a webcam in what appear to be empty offices and college dorm rooms, then edited on prezi and Microsoft powerpoint. I know this sounds harsh but with the constant online endorsement of this service I expected a lot more from a paid subscription. Maybe it's better for more technical skills."", ""I can't believe how easy and very useful help I am getting from this app. Free. I'm speechless I'm learning so much about music to help me grow and produce sounds from amazing people.... you have to weed through so many apps to find the few and far between that aren't a waste of your time.... This app I recommend to anyone interested I'm learning online..... I'm so excited to continue even after the free trial because it's perfect...."", ""Great platform, content is monitored and updated. This platform is not really for beginners I noticed, you need some background knowledge on most topics as the instructors give a direct lessons on what and how in very short and to the point matter. Over all great if you're looking to expand your knowledge, not really learn something from scratch."", ""disappointed in the app and the company. great concept, sub-par delivery. the classes aren't dated, so you have no idea what's still relevant. limited sorting and filtering. very big range in quality of teaching. opened the app today and it didn't resume or show any indication of where i left off. the ability to increase/decrease the playback speed has also disappeared. i definitely won't be renewing with this company."", ""The opportunity to take even basic courses in things I already am interested in is wonderful. The ability to get another's perspective on issues I tackle within myself has helped me to pull myself up and out of situations where I felt I'd gotten trapped is refreshing. Unfortunately, as others have noticed, there are times when I can't get a class or even a video to start regardless of the quality of my internet speed. That is very frustrating when you're strapped for time."", ""I do really love Skillshare and am glad I have a subscription to it. There are so many classes that have taught me so much. I enjoy the way they are segmented into small parts for easy management. BUT the skillshare app needs some work. It feels like a beta version. It's clunky and at times glitches out. Some aspects of its software don't even seem to be built for the application, like they were copied from the desktop website. It's a usable app and I still use it, but it could be better."", ""SkillShares app offers all of the amazing, and polished courses you'll find on their desktop website. I often use it as a way to cast courses to my living room TV if I want to enjoy a class with my girlfriend or just want to get out of the office. Outside of that, the app is clunky, and very difficult to search or find much. More than anything it needs better filter searches and easier navigation. Outside of that, the content is what to expect, fantastic."", ""Edit 2: Can't click away from the app or it will just keep crashing from there. Rating 1 star as it's unusable. Edit: I uninstalled and re-installed the app. It got past the loading screen and seems to be working. Hopefully we won't have any more issues. Started using it about twenty minutes ago. Went away from the app to a website that a video recommended. Now when I open the app, it just crashes. I'm on the Galaxy S10. It wouldn't let me send feedback for some reason, so this is my feedback."", ""I would give this 5 stars if it did well with bad internet. This app has a hard time recovering. When I'm searching something up sometimes it gives me, maybe 10 options, out of thousands and it doesn't load the rest. Other times I'm watching a video and it stops and doesn't start again and instead restarts or I have to get out then get back in. I don't have this problem so frequently with any other app. Other than that this is amazing. I'm learning a bunch and fully recommend."", ""I'd be happier with it if I could do split screen, but every time I try it pauses as soon as I touch the other screen. Kind of pointless for it to let me even open it in split screen just to not play the video/ lesson. I get that they want you to learn from the lessons, but there are Somme that you're better off just listening to as you search for whatever creative thing is in your mind."", ""As a mom with limited time this was the perfect app for me!!! I wanted to learn different kinds of creative techniques and you can find it all, I usually watch it while my baby naps. The only thing I don't love about it, and actually hate, is how you cannot organize the classes trough your phone or tablet, they depend a lot on computers and that doesn't fit my life style, that is making me want to explore other learning apps, to see if one of them would offer a better interface..."", ""at first the app didnt recognize that my account was premium. I had set the skillshare account up on my laptop and wanted it on my phone when I'm not home. It had my account on premium but all the content was locked. I had to uninstall and reinstall for it to work but now it's great. I like the download feature because it's useful on airplanes and subways. I like that you can play at different speeds too which is great if someone talks very slow or rambles on before they get to the point."", ""I'm sorry to say, the UX of the android app is pretty bad. For example, after poking about quite a lot, I was unable to even change my profile picture. On the contrary, their website, even on a mobile browser is MUCH more usable. Here is an examples of my frustrations: - To browse by category, the user needs to scroll all the way to the bottom and then click on a dropdown menu. On the other hand a simple hamburger menu with categories would easily make the app much more usable."", ""Glitchy and hard to navigate. For all the classes available, this app makes it really difficult to explore options. You have to KNOW exactly what you want to learn, OR just be willing to start any old class and see what happens. But if you are interested in exploring a topic, the categories are just too broad. Plus, you can't access most of the course 'extras' and none of the documents, so say you want to learn to paint a dog in watercolor, you can't see the instructor's PDF sketches."", ""I love this app. I've been using my downtime to learn a lot of useful skills. I was going to try to just learn what I could during the free trial, but just ended up purchasing the year subscription. There's a lot of relevant content. I prefer their set up compared to udemy's. Rather than taking your chances on buying one class, you can try out a variety for one price."", ""Skillshare as a service is pretty legit as far as I can tell, I just have the free service for now as I browse the library. The app, however, is weird to navigate, and not particularly user freindly. It took me a bit to figure out how to search the catalog of classes & add classes to my list. Also, could use a night mode. The constant downward scrolling with the white background made me very motion sick even with my phone's brightness on lowest setting."", 'The service itself is awesome and has been very helpful in creating an environment of learning in my life. I have so many new things I know! The app could use a little work, mostly in the playback features. Sometimes the next lesson will just notnplay and i have had to reset the app to get it to work. Love the service, a little work on the app and this goes to five stars, easy.', ""Awful experience. I paid $99.99 for this service in 2018 and constantly found myself unable to access content because videos were locked in spite of me being a premium member. When I could use the app my saved classes constantly disappeared and video load times took forever because you can only watch in HD. Needless to say I stopped using it after a very short time. I have now been charged for another year subscription for 2019 because it apparently auto renews and have been denied a refund even though the app still doesn't work, I haven't used it, and I requested the refund within 24 hours of being notified of the charge. $99.99 is no small amount to lose for an app that isn't functional."", ""It's a fantastic app with some amazing tutorials. Definitely the best one on the market. The search option is pretty iffy if you're looking for a specific course, even typing the exact name couldn't find me the course, but I eventually found the one I was looking for anyway. Outside of that minor inconvenience the app runs great, looks great and is extremely helpful."", ""Let us have specific control over the video quality, holy geez. It's so freaking basic. Instead, I just have to keep rewinding 30 seconds and *hoping* that it decides to switch to a higher quality so that I can actually see anything. I often have to rewind 6 or 7 times before it decides to switch quality. Or at the very least, let us choose specifically which lessons to download, instead of having to download the whole dang class. Not all of us live in Silicon Valley with hyper fast internet."", ""Love Skillshare! For instructors, there could be some additions included for better structuring of content. For example, the ability to add sections in a course and the ability to add articles or attachments as course lectures. So some features could be improved so that teachers may be more effective in their teaching, but overall, it's an excellent platform."", ""The service looks good.  I haven't watch classes yet but they look like they will be good though.  However that app has one glaring flaw that is inexcusable in 2019 that makes the app itself 1 star automatically in my book.  You can not download videos to your SD card. At least I can't find a way to do it.  So you have to fill the device storage up with videos if you want to download them for offline viewing.  Making that feature pretty much unusable unless you have a basically empty phone as even a 36 min class is over half a gig.  Which is not surprising since HD videos are large files.  Which is why with competently made video apps you can download them to the SD card instead of the device storage.  If you could download the classes to the SD card it would be a 5 star app as the rest works well and is simple to use."", ""I haven't used any of the classes they offer YET, but I would like to rate this app 5 stars for the excellent customer service they provided! I was mistaken and didn't realize that after the free trial, I would be automatically billed their annual amount of $99. Immediately i was horrified and reached out to their CS with a simple email stating that I didn't mean to pay, and within an hour the amount was immediately refunded back to me. Thanks Skillshare for understanding and being awesome!"", ""Ok so I've had this app for a day thanks to GMM. I got 2 months free. So I tried it out... absolutely wonderful!! Love the courses. Easy to use. Lots of helpful stuff. Didn't realize there was so much stuff to do with my career/passion. Cinematography. Lots of camera and editing videos. Love it! Will most likely be paying for it once the 2 months run out. Only downside is it seems to take a bit to load. And I wish it had features like YouTube. Skip or back 10 seconds. And auto rotate.. but oh well. Still a good site/app"", 'So far, I am enjoying the couple lessons Ive done. However, the teachers have mentioned handouts or attachments and what not which I have not been able to find in the mobile app version. Also, on every class now, if I pause and move off the video to either another app or just to another page within skillshare once I go back to the class and hit play it wont play. I have to completely close out of skillshare and stop the running of the app totally and reboot before it will play again. Fyi.', ""At first I wasn't sure if the subscription fee would be worth it. I thought I would try the free trial and cancel before the due date. Wow, was I surprised. Skillshare offers a multitude of phenomenal classes. I find myself clicking this app instead of playing games. I have tried classes I never even thought I would be interested in. I love the variety of offerings and will most likely never get through my wishlist of courses. No glitches or lag time, the app runs flawlessly, love it!"", ""I've used skillshare for a little over a month now, and its one of the best investments I've made. I can learn anything I want with the click of a few buttons. Navigation could be a little easier, but its great overall. As far as it charging people for the service goes, its not Skillshare's responsibility when consumers can't handle their finances. I pay annually for my subscription and have yet to have any issues. People need to be more responsible. Excellent service though."", ""This app is Awesome! Has a ton of different courses on different subjects. Easy to use and understand. Can be interactive, sometimes the instructor urges you to start a project with them or apply what was taught within the course to a current project you're working on and to share with you're perfect on skillshare. Best of all you can go at your go at your own pace, no rush."", ""Great easy flow app & website, content is (generally) quality. I dont know if this is a thing with the app but the keyword search seems off, not pulling up things even if I typed in the title, also I don't think it has actual key WORD searches. The other mini problem is on the app it autoplays classes after the intro, which sucks if your slow /have a busy life. You kinda end up starting a class you don't want to."", ""I didn't know that I was on the lookout for something like skillshare for a long time, till I found Skillshare. This is one online learning app that opens all doors to learning at your convenience and at a very reasonable price. You do not have to pay for different courses separately. You just pay the annual subscriptions and you have access to myriad courses on a variety of topics. The instructors are top-notch and the way the courses are delivered is better than most I have seen. Great job!!"", ""Skillshare = Awesome! App Feedback: The courses never save/return where I'm at, the app always starts me at the first video, or some random spot in a video I already watched. The video player is also finicky. It doesn't always recognize what I touched (enter or exit fullscreen, play/pause, touch to open/close the overlay to see video options). And a recent bug from the Android 10 update, while I'm watching a fullscreen video and when the phone goes into battery saver mode the app glitches.""]","['org.domestika', 'com.udemy.android', 'org.coursera.android', 'org.edx.mobile', 'com.tgc.greatcoursesplus']",https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.skillshare.Skillshare&hl=en&gl=us

This app gives information that valuable for a learner but just barely. It is not my Idea of a well developed tutorial on any subject.

I came across this app and decided to download it to touch up on what I've learned, as well as to learn some new languages. I must say I'm very impressed!

It's annoying but tolerable. A code language dictionary would be wonderful as in text references. Like a word definer but instead it's a popup of manual pages relevant to the code."", ""My only real gripe is too much is held hostage behind the pay wall (at least for Java, guessing it's the same for all tho). For people truly beginning with little or no experience, most of the practice options are essentially locked, which makes learning all the harder since many lessons are just filling in basic keywords and not actual coding. I'm on lesson 9, and have only 'earned' enough in game currency to unlock 2 practice sessions... will stick with it as seeing the code is still helpful"", 'Very helpful for learning basics!

If this is all your using to learn, then you'll definitely need pro. If you pair it with a book or two, you can get away with just using the free version, by doing the exercises in the book. They added way more ads recently, which sucks. It's very annoying. Just purchased pro yesterday and it's way better than the free version was last year. Use the free version for a while then go pro."", ""The app is amazing! It has multiple languages to learn, and doesn't have a required subscription. It does have a subscription but it's $7 monthly or $4 a month if you pay yearly, BUT it's only for ad free learning, more free trials (for looking at the examples), and more learning tracks. I've made it through ~20 JS and Python lessons EACH and and have only had one 30 second ad. Best part of it all is that it's completing free!

What also discouraged me from investing is the fact I was told I was getting bits for the streaks for logging on daily but did not receive anything. And this happened twice."", ""This app is great. By far the best Duolingo style app for coding. It's not gonna teach you how to be a senior developer for Microsoft just like Duolingo won't make you fluent in Spanish, but it will help you practice and cement certain ideas in your head. The ads are unobtrusive and actually relevant. The only ads I saw were for software engineering course at different schools. Easily skipable."", 'This is my first time leaving a review on an app but Sololearn is absolutely worth it. I have spent months attempting to teach myself Python via various free online ""camps"" but failing after feeling I didn\'t fully understand the use for the things I was learning.

Absolutely worth trying.', 'I just recently started using the pro version of this app so I can use the practice functions and access more lessons. Even before purchasing it though the app is very well organized and is a very valuable learning tool. I am currently enrolled in programming classes in college and this really helps me with my classes. It helps me review lessons I had a hard time understanding at first and it also helps me look ahead in lessons. I highly recommend purchasing the AFFORDABLE pro version!!!!', ""This is an incredibly challenging yet efficent app that I have started to use for learning all sorts of programming! One tip to newcomers that don't want to pay for the pro though, make sure to have a code editor open whilst using the app so you can test code without having to pay, also if there's a lesson you want to learn, but it costs bits just move on until you have enough from the free lessons!"", ""Straight up amazing. I've started the GoLang course, and I'm almost done with it within like 2 weeks of starting! It's amazing. I'm also quite experienced. This made it hard to find courses for me. But these courses are actually for everyone!!! Definitely recommending to everyone who I know wants to learn to code."", 'Great app to get into the basics. Some of the lessons lack information required to complete. Thankfully, the comments for each lesson are very informational and typically provide the right push to get an answer. Quite a bit of features require the paid Pro version. Seems like a worthwhile investment considering what coding knowledge can provide as far as income.', ""Pretty good overall! This app is easy to use and it has a lot of free content for many different languages. My only problem is that sometimes, a few of the test cases are behind paywalls. If I get something wrong, I wouldnt be able to figure what happened if I can't see the input or output."", ""I absolutely love this app. I am trying to learn Python from a hobbyist perspective to use on RPi projects. This app does a fantastic job of segmenting learning modules to help with retention of the information. There is a lot to learn with coding; it's absorbed much better when taken in small bites. Even the free version offers plenty of opportunity to practice. Love it!!!!!!"", 'It used to be this great app for practice. Now the app that aims to teach coding is ironically full of bugs both on the app and the web version. ""Oops, something went wrong"" pops up all the time on the app, while the web version requires you to subscribe to the premium version for the simple feature of a code editor. Seems like a dirty trick to lure some to try premium version by a made-up bug instead of being honest with the users. Anyway, I\'m not taking back my review, unless they fix it.', ""I really like this app, its great for casual coding and it really helped me last year to brush up for my C++ class. The one thing I don't like is the heart system they just added, on the free version you can only make 5 mistakes in a session, which I really think is a bad feature. Learning is way less fun when you're punished for making mistakes."", ""Great for beginners. This is what I used years ago to get started. But it does kinda handicap you. Programming isn't hard, but this does hide a lot of more complex topics that may inhibit a learner from ever hearing about some topics. In other words, use it to get a basic understanding. But you have to branch out to other methods of learning (pluralsight, books, etc) eventually"", 'Trying to open the app after my initial use seems to crash it before anything can even load on my screen. Have tried this a couple times now (uninstalling and reinstalling). I download and use the app the first time. Exit and kill the app. Then try to reopen it for a subsequent use (minutes, hours, or days after first) only to have it crash immediately. Very strange bug.. would love to see this fixed so I can utilize what seems to be a wonderful learning tool accordingly :)', ""Small bite sized lessons that are easy to absorb. You can always go back and review lessons you've already completed if you need to. Lessons need to be completed in order to unlock the next one to keep you from getting ahead of yourself and getting overwhelmed and quitting. The try it yourself code playground text editor in each lesson is fun to test what you've learned. Didn't think learning to code could be this easy, convenient and enjoyable! Awsome app! Loving it!!! üëçüòä"", ""The new interface is so godawful. What were they thinking when they redesigned this? It was perfectly fine before. Now, it's counterintuitive, cluttered, and navigating the courses and modules is so damn confusing and convoluted. And they took away the option to complete courses as a guest user. This platform has really gone downhill. Disappointing."", ""I usually don't leave reviews, but this app has been so helpful and educational. I've learned so much in a short period of time. The lessons are simple and condensed, and make it super easy to learn small bits throughout the day, or a lot at once in a binge. It organizes the lessons in a sensible way, and where most textbooks would make the lessons overwhelming to look at, this app breaks everything into pieces and makes it easy as possible to learn. Highly recommended."", ""Out of all of the coding teaching apps I've used, this one seems to have the most options available to learn. The practice challenges can be a struggle at times. I've seen some challenges that started off with syntax errors and sometimes the IDE doesn't work as well as visiting this site on a computer. But overall, this is a great app to keep practicing on the go. I recommend using a computer for solo learn whenever able. Though would like there to be a way to test our excercises."", ""Short lesson and review is extremely helpful for those with a busy life. I can hop on, run through 2 or 3 sections and learn the basics. The competition portion helps to keep people motivated and makes it more entertaining to learn. The amount of languages is very impressive for a free app that is stable and easy to read through. The community is fantastic. If you don't understand the material based on the way the app explains it, go to the comments section for a better explanation! Love it!"", ""This app reminds me of a coding version of duolingo. However that doesn't do it justice. This app makes me feel more motivated to continue onto the next set of studying because each block is relatively short (approx 3-5 questions per) and you can see the next blocks that you have left. It doesn't feel overwhelming or make you feel like you're not getting anywhere. That's what I think this app has over the other ones. And if you do have to pause, you can easily bookmark it. 5/5"", 'It is a good stepwise learning experience, presented in small bit size pieces. As it is easy to step your way through the tutorial, I will personally need to revisit the the various sections and practice a great deal for information retention. I have had a good deal of experience in some older languages. This makes it easier to grasp most of the concepts, but it appears to be presented in a way that should make it useful to new students also.', ""Great app so far, very well laid out courses that won't leave you hanging, there is a chat that people can post in specifically for that section of the lesson, and there is a ton of great information on there too, everything is in the app, the ads a little confusing at first, and so is the course layout, but once you get through it it's fine, the ads between courses are short and give you a small breather between lessons. I did the HTML, and I'm almost done with CSS, then JavaScript next..."", 'Thos is probably the best way to organize an immersive learning experience on your phone. For me, it would be better if the lesson and the ""try it yourself"" appeared in separate panes on the same page rather than linking to it and going back and forth, but the fact that you actually get the oppportunity ro try it rather than rolling through lessons and passing multiple choice tests aids in retention much better than most training apps in the same field.', 'This app is easy to use and learn from. The lessons are small in size so you can work on them at any time. The examples given are not extensive, but are sufficient (and probably more useful) being small for the tutorials. If more learning is needed, there are different options for learning more: a forum for each lesson, editable/executable code in an online environment, and more reading. Ads are present for the free version, but where are they not? Very nice app.', ""I love this app, I 100% recommend it to anyone that is getting into programming. This app has tons of programming languages to learn, it's amazing. It's been only a few hours and my understanding of c# is much much better! The ads aren't even annoying, you don't get many ads at all, and when you do you either have to wait 5 seconds, or you can close it instantly. Amazing app, definitely use it if your trying to learn any programming language."", ""I love this App. I have been working on programming for a little while and I finally started taking formal classes Thanks to this app, I have a lot of experience and I am learning that I already knew the majority of the skills. There are a few shortcomings: certain lessons such as the algorithm lesson are incomplete, that is to say, they don't present concrete examples of how to implement the algorithms which left me fairly confused. There also seems to be a stigma that beginners are capable of creating somewhat complicated programs such as the challenge to turn a string of a date into a date that references a day of the week. Even with all the formal lessons and Solo Learn lessons, so still can't figure out that one.
