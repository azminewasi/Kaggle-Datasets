BYJU'S – The Learning App,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.byjus.thelearningapp&hl=en&gl=us,"['This app is good, contains helpful learning material but there is a problem. Whenever I open a video lesson, the video quality is so poor that nothing is visible clearly and also the videos take a long time to load, there is a lot of buffering. This is the only issue that I find in this app. It would be very helpful if this problem gets solved. Otherwise, everything is good, keep up the good work. I would be highly obliged if this problem gets fixed. Thank you very much.', ""What just happened!, I was trying to contact byjus via email but this out to work. The app was beautiful and perfect! The updates you guys did are an improvement but I don't understand why the app interface changed. The app was really encouraging and easy to use but now it looks bland and I don't even like using it anymore, the pictures were vivid and cartoonized. (When you enter the app it is just absolutely discouraging)"", ""I don't know what happened to this app. After this latest update (March 2022) it is good that they changed a lot of it in this update. Changing the background to fonts and everything. But this update was not successful because after this there are a lot of lags and bugs in the interference even though i have connected with a fast wi- fi connection. Please solve all the bugs in the videos and background"", 'Yeah.. social science and maths are really well explained and taught. But the biggest downfall is the science section and especially physics which is so overrated except few chapters, you would have to re-watch every other a hundred times to understand what they say, I feel their pace too high. They should first elaborate well and then go with their high theatre films. And why in the practices and tests the same bunch of questions repeated a thousand time; that I must is say frustrating 🤣', ""The way the teachers explain things is so good. And the practices right afterwards are useful for sure. I study in an English version college in my country so it's hard to get my study subjects and chapters in an organized way in English. This app is probably exactly what i needed."", 'Very good app. Now I can Clear the concepts with upmost interest. Visualising the concepts instead of mugging up helps to remember best. Videos, activities and tests are very interesting and encouraging. If can will give 5.1 out of 5 stars.', ""The free contents should not be limited because if someone is studying for exam, it hinders their study. The exam date is fixed. So is the study schedule of the individual. If you can't provide, then don't post free contents at all. Instead of waiting for long days to view next videos and revising only 4-5 videos for longer periods till next videos, it's best to install the app right away and go for books or YouTube videos."", 'I really enjoy using byjusexamprep daily quizzes, mock tests, and previous papers. byjusexamprep is a helpful teaching method for teachers. The syllabus structure and timetable are very flexible. I really appreciate the hard work behind the technical people too that they have provided us with proper notes and quizzes. I like byjusexamprep and it is one of the best App.', ""I Gave this app a 3 star rating last month. I don't know if that issue is solved or not BUT the New version released just now is worse. Like seriously!!!! When you pause the video you go back. When you start the video you go back. I can't make notes when it can't go smooth. New version have new things but this thing in particular is a Headache seriously. Hope you fix this ASAP."", ""In IAS subscriptions Early subscribers are dealt by the mentorship nicely but when it has been some time they stop paying attention to your problems and complaints. Its been a whole month I've raised my query. Mails, calls, everything in vain. Everytime I have to repeat my issue and it is very frustrating. They just assure you of transferring calls to seniors and resolving issues but they don't do it. More like government office treatment."", ""This app has the worst customer care services, I've subscribe to it a few months ago and I didn't like it so I tried to contact customer care inorder to cancel my subscription but they don't seem to be of any help and some of them even gets angry when I try to contact them,that is what makes me annoyed. Yea..And and thanks to this stupid subscribtion money is being deducted from my account every month without an end to it. Have some SHAME BYJU'S."", ""The topics on byjus are crisp n clear, fun, and intresting. The reason behind why I've given 2 stars is that, it always asks for the OTP whenever I open the application. It is also annoying when the byjus team calls us to enroll in the classes. When you go on with a particular topic for a few days or so, suddenly it says going at a great pace, denying us to open the topic. After all I had a Average experience with byjus."", ""there's elevator music playing behind every video which can be distracting and the byju's watermark is also distracting and idk if this is just a problem I'm facing but the audio is distraughted. the visuals are nice and help you understand but they also make unnecessary noise which can take away from the main lesson."", 'The teachers are very good and the explanation is beautiful too. My only problem is that the games sometimes get stuck and i have to re-do it 3-4 times. There is no skip option for the games either.', ""App is good but I'm feeling uncomfortable as it is only available in landscape mode in my Samsung galaxy tab A. I would suggest that it must be available in both Portrait and landscape mode so that students feeling better with any mode can perform their best in the paid test series."", 'The app is very good, very beautiful features, But if there was a language option would be very good, such as bengali, hindi etc then the videos would be very convenient to understand. And there is no computer application subject in this app.', ""I have been using this app for a long period of time but today suddenly when I opened one video on it , it is not opening and showing that to access this features is only available to the premiums,to access videos you have to subscribe for byju's.

Totally big disappointment from byjus. Initially it was good to use."", ""You never resolve any issue , whenever I contact you , you just there are glitches because of this app being the free version , so ok you won't solve them ?

But in the case of mock tests,it is okay upto the completion of the exam but at the time of submission the app is getting strucked such that we cant see our results and it is showing to write down the exam again. I observed this many times. This is getting problamatic. Hope you guys check it. Thank you', ""I'm a huge fan of BYJU'S The Learning App and I truly appreciate it. It helps us to understand all topics in all subjects the simple ones, even the most difficult topics they teach us in a simple and convenient way and of course the teaching methods of India's Best Teachers are absolutely awesome and amazing including the conversion from difficult topics to the simplest version. I highly recommend to all of you to use this app because Come And Fall In Love With Learning."", ""It's a really good app I love the way teaches us and the explanation is very clear and good we can understand it easily it helps me a lot.

Overall its very good app<8"", ""Its true!!What byju's says is true.Really it makes learning fun by providing 3D visuality for understanding the concepts which is actually amazing❤.There are many concepts which are difficult to imagine but byju's provides us the visuality which is needed perfectly👍👍👌.And even the teachers are perfect!!Very highly skilled.But recently it is taking more time to load. Really very much thanks for your big help."", ""This is the best app ever for studying. It helps you remember everything forever !!

It helps me a lot in my studies. Thank you so much BYJU'S....🙏🙏🙏"", ""Worst experience of all time. Bad customers sevice, disconnects calls as I tell my problems. No replys of emails. Took a loan from for byju's app but after the cancellation request made a month ago no communication is made I have to pay EMIs despite my cancellation but they didnt cancel my subscription. And after 1 and half months of cancellation they haven't refunded my money. And I have to pay EMI on that. want to give zero star but it's not available."", ""The app is good, easy to understand UI but the problem is that videos don't have transcripts. You should add transcripts and written stuff cause vidoes do not always load properly."", ""The latest update is very disruptive while studying because it's start functioning without being commanded like in mid of video it change it's portrait mode to landscape on its own and many more problems are faced using it."", ""It's really a fascinating and interesting app. The video lectures are so animated and the way teachers teach is also great.

Hope they change that.', ""this app is very good and important to every interested learner, who wants to learn in every situation but unfortunately this app is not supported in my laptop and I use in phone. your teacher is superb every doubting question will be clearly understand we all are in a innovative era and we all want a learning and want a help to a needy children, those who want a learning and believe that they will be a something that's why god created them. thank you BYJU;S for your help."", 'This application is good and give best visualization but it\'s game are not loading properly and the games are not working properly. I was learnt 2 topics then it is showing that ""you can learn other topics in 19 days "" which I hated it. Many topics of many subjects are not opening and only asked to give tests, practice or quizzo. Please fix it . I really hated it because of this demerits. It\'s old design of app was the best design than the present design.', ""This is very helpful platform indeed! Covers all aspects of each and every subject and all the problems are solved easily with the special techniques that teachers provide. Thank you BYJU's <3"", 'Worst app ever . Whenever i open the app it get stuck . Very dissapointed. Their is no personalised path to learn concept which is very bad. I used to study from byjus because of this reason.

Duolingo: language lessons,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duolingo&hl=en&gl=us,"[""Love supporting Duolingo. What a great service!!!! But there is a lot that's frustrating. The 'send' button submits answer, but it's right next to the back button so alot of answers are submitted incorrectly when I'm trying to fix them. Lots of confusion about when to use male/female pronouns when there are no context clues given, just take a guess! The progress quizzes don't have anything to do with what I've learned, so I end up just guessing and failing."", ""Overall, it s a good app. But there are a few things, it crashes a lot and everytime you do, if you spent diamonds, they don't return. For the challenges, how are we supposed to write down a whole series of paragraphs one after the other with such little time? It almost feels like a grab something mwyimez"", 'Although I wanted to give this 5 stars for the lessons, which are good, I have to really pull this down for attitude and odd bugs. They claim throughout this is a no-pressure way to learn, but that\'s not true. There\'s a heavy focus on a point system. The App bothers you with notifications to keep your streak going. There\'s tremendous pressure to keep points up & not go into the ""demotion zone."" The ability to remain in your level increases. All this ""no-pressure"" competition damages learning.', 'Using the free version. I enjoy it, but some things annoy me. Every once in a while I get something wrong because of autocorrect or some other technology related issue. Also, they challenge you to learn the language in lots of different ways, which is good, but the randomness of the switching can sometimes trick you. Especially when having to translate what you heard then the next question is not translating but writing out what you heard. Then I run out of lives. Just spoils it a little for me.', ""First, one star off for no way to report bugs in the app. Second star off for a bug worth reporting. This has been a pretty good app, until a couple of weeks ago. I used it for Spanish a couple of years ago, now Chinese for a year. All of a sudden the text in the buttons has the bottom third cut off. Both pinyin and simplified characters. This vastly reduces the effectiveness of the app for learning. I'll switch to another until this bug is fixed."", 'I\'m a little over a year in and want to give this 5 stars but I just can\'t. Overall this is an excellent app, but if you\'re serious about learning you really need the paid version (it\'s worth it). Paid has both a monthly and yearly option and no punishment for mistakes. Problems are that it\'s way too ""gamey"" and having leaderboards makes it stressful. Worse than that is that there are NO grammar rules provided, which negatively impacts learning. Also too cartoonish. Still a great learning tool.', 'This is a good app for learning another language! I had previously downloaded it but didn\'t really use it that much until they finally added Finnish... the language I really wanted to learn. My only two problems I have with this app that I would like to point out are that the whole thing with the hearts and ""running out"" of them is starting to get rather annoying and I find it to be counterintuitive and holding me back. Also, so far, it seems less ""conversational"" content and more piece of one.', ""The whole experience is fun and you are guided through progressively more challenging learning situations. Be careful of technical challenges. Sometimes the microphone doesn't work correctly and you can end up losing a lot of hearts. Outside of this it has been and continues to be a good experience. I do feel more confident speaking Spanish at work and my colleagues say they hear an improvement in my language skills. Yeah! Thank you Duolingo."", 'The application is good it increases the level according to your capabilities the only problem that I find is that sometimes you cannot see the pairing exercises on the phone and some translations are weird to the English language. Other than that, it is great. It provides different ways to encourage you to continue learning and some tips to clarify your thinking. I wish it would have more of those. The taking exercise turns off before speaking at times. Thank you for making it free.', ""I've had it maybe 2 yrs and for learning it is great. You do get out of it what u put in it tho so be prepared. My main issue tho is that I get docked streak freezes when I have done the lesson! At first I thought maybe I was wrong but it continues to happen and I've started paying closer attention for that reason. No idea what the issue is. I make sure to watch the ENTIRE AD at the end of my lessons thinking maybe that by closing the app when I'm done it doesn't give me credit. Nope, not it."", ""Decent, but I wish there were better ways to review words you've leavened considering reviewing and repetition is an integral part of learning a new language. You have a list, but I wish when you clicked on a word you learned, it offered the definition and verb conjugation. I think I'll just have to have a notebook on hand during the lesson and write my own verb tree immediately (which is also important so I don't mind that) or you'll miss it. I tried to find a forum, but Duolingo deleted all."", ""the continue button (icon?) covers instructions, the exercise where the choices are in little circles aren't centered so you can't see them, some exercises the words you are supposed to select as a choice for what you hear are below the edge of the screen so you can't select them. when the exercise works, they work great. unfortunately about a quarter of the time you can't access the correct answer or it isn't visible on the screen. too bad, it looks pretty good otherwise"", ""This review is for the Korean course. The course has improved significantly since I first started and is a lot more immersive now. I still wish all the new words in each lesson were introduced at the beginning of the lesson instead of as they come, but I can live with that. What I can't live with, and what makes this lose 2 stars is the leaderboard. I would pay for duolingo if you could opt out of the leaderboard. I hate the added pressure it gives and want it gone. I won't pay until it happens."", 'It\'s good for practicing recall, but when you get beyond the basics you\'ll realize that the translations they\'re giving you for certain sentences are approximations not exact translations, which is frustrating. For example they gave me a sentence in German that literally translates to ""The library is in the vicinity"" but ""in the vicinity"" wasn\'t an option I could select to build the sentence, so I had to select ""nearby"". My brain doesn\'t work like that, I need the exact translation.', ""Genuinely a quality language learning resource. Free version has ads; you can pay a subscription to go ad-free. I didn't realize this when I first downloaded it and paid for a year because I thought I had to, but honestly thought the price was good for the quality of the product. Using the free version now, an ad plays at the end of each lesson, but are less obnoxious than some apps I use"", ""Great app, very intuitive. It teaches without ever speaking English, but never becomes too complicated. The hearts system is abysmal though, you can only make up to 5 mistakes, which are inevitable when learning new material, then you're not able to take new lessons for a few hours. This makes taking new lessons harder and practicing old material just to keep your streak the easiest option. The only way to stop this is to pay for Duolingo plus. To recap: great app, but harder for free learners."", ""I'm so tired of incorrect audio screwing up my scores, and now there's a bug that ruins player's streaks, which only really means anything if extrinsic motivation is a factor, but it's honestly what keeps a lot of people coming back every day. If they're not going to fix these problems, I don't see a reason not to find a better language learning app."", ""Overall the app is pretty good. However, that being said there's a lot of room to improve. First, I'm not 22 and find the whole game like experience annoying and condescending. I don't need points, gems, hearts etc. I would prefer statistics and quantified measurements. I would certainly consider a paid version but nowhere can I find the cost and features listed. I'm not going to buy anything unseen. Providing downloadable vocab lists and progress stats would be a great reason to pay."", ""I've used Duolingo almost 5 years, and learned a ton from it. The quality and depth of each language program is varied - if you aren't learning one of the major ones like French, German, Spanish, English etc. often it is less well-directed, and will offer less explanation, leaving much more for you to do on your own. In general though, it is perfect as an accessory alongside vocabulary, listening, and speaking practice when learning another language."", ""Update: I have to drop the stars because now I'm in the higher levels, the heart thing is preventing me from making any progress. I also can't compete on the leader board with paying subscribers. It's too bad, but I'm done - it's too frustrating. I have had a lot of fun learning Español and freshening up my Deutsch. It's easy to fit in time to study everyday. Duolingo takes the intimidation out of learning a language and has taken the place of all the games on my phone!!!"", 'App is great most of the time!! It is impossible to talk to a person and I have easily lost 1000 credits using a streak freeze when I completed the excercise on the same day!! This may seem menial but it had cost me many hard earned points and I dedicate myself to reaching the 365 day streak. I have numerous screen shots but no way to fix the issue!!', ""Decent app and learning modules. The in app advertisements are a huge pain lately. After each lesson we noramlly have a short ad that you can skip after a short period. Now the ads do not seem to have that option and at the end of the add there is no way close out and continue learning. I must close the app and re-open the app to continue. This is the second time in the last 30 days this has happened. Third strike and you're out!"", ""I've been using Duolingo for about 3 YEARS! now, and really am enjoying the app. The pace of learning is totally up to you, and you can test out of easier levels if you already have some language familiarity. I appreciate the reminders, the variety of speaking reading and translating back and forth. There are challenges, practices, review of past mistakes, lessons, and even stories!!! Try it!"", ""While this has the potential to be a fun way to work on vocabulary for learning a language, the support for the app is nonexistent. The amounts of ads in the free version as well as being locked out for making mistakes makes it almost unusable, so I tried the premium version for my whole family. There were a lot of bugs and issues with getting access to features like following friends or in game power ups. The only thing you can do is to file a bug report, but I didn't get a reply or any help."", 'Duolingo is an excellent app for casual language learning. It is great for learning basic vocabulary, grammar, and does so in a variety of exercises and stories (which I love) to keep one busy. That said, one thing that disappoints me is the decline of the free version. I have used the app long enough to know when it was just ads, and no 5 lives. When they added gems, and the five lives, I knew microtransactions were coming, while ads would remain. First create a problem, then sell a solution', ""Great way to learn Spanish. Much better than text books and memorizing a lot of info. More like learning as a kid by hearing and repetition. Every once in a while though, my answer choice is covered by the check box so I can't respond correctly. Also, it doesn't recognize my microphone so I don't speak. Otherwise, happy with the app."", ""I find it useful for brushing up on a language I already know. I haven't used it to learn an unfamiliar language, but it seems less ideal for that because it doesn't really explain anything. E.g., when an answer is marked wrong, there's no explanation of what specifically was wrong. Obviously there's only so much they can do, since all they have are a bunch of candidate answers that they're matching against, but even with that, I think they could do better. The correct answer they offer may differ in multiple ways from the user-provided answer, but it often turns out that most of those difference are fine, and the real problem was just a hard-to-notice typo. That can result in the user doubting their own correct understanding and just learning to parrot what DL offers as correct. I think it would be better if they showed the closest candidate answer by edit distance, ideally highlighting the difference. I dislike the over-the-top gamification and social elements. I don't really want to solicit pats on the back from friends and family for every little achievement. No doubt their engagement metrics and subscriptions go up whenever they tweak the game to be more manipulative, but I'd turn that all off if it were an option. They added new voice models for their computer-generated text-to-speech for the purpose of having different characters with distinct voices. While the quality of the TTS in general is pretty good, I find it inconsistent, at least for the Italian. For one of the kid voices in particular, it can be really difficult to tell what consonant is supposedly being said. Even knowing from context which words are likely, it's sometimes a guessing game. I wish it were an option to switch to a different voice."", 'Duolingo is fantastic. I am truly enjoying this platform. It makes it extremely convenient and fun to learn a language in this manner. I took Spanish immersion classes my first year of college and spoke it off & on through the years. It has really started to come back. The format the exercises are in make it fun & relatively easy to work through. Cheers!!', ""I love duolingo so much. It's somewhat life-changing. It's an invaluable tool for language learning. It gives me really good brain exercise, and (more importantly) consistent brain exercise. The leader boards, daily reminders etc are so helpful and encouraging for keeping a consistent practice. I highly recommend it to people all the time. Thank you duo."", ""I'm on the 2 week trial to see if I want to buy it for the family. It's actually really good and motivating but once you get to level three you start having memorizing which nouns are masculine, feminine, and neuter. If you had the option to create flashcards (in this app) from each lesson on the words that you're struggling with; this would be a five-star app, no question."", ""It's a decent program, it mostly works as intended. However some longer words when forced to type the question when there is one word wrong but you can clearly see it is the correct word, will be counted wrong. When you speak into the phone it will occasionally not hear what you said and you lose a heart.. its a program designed to make you pay. I would recommend babbel over duolingo"", ""The app itself works as intended. Perhaps it works for some, not for me. It's far too discouraging. To advance, you are obviously competing with bots & people who are plus members. I get it; they want you to pay, but all the advertising pop ups ARE paying... If you work hard to move up, but for some reason can't spend the time, you get demoted and have to work your way back up. How is this encouragement? difficult to figure out sentence structure with no explanations. Too many negatives to list"", ""Duolingo is amazing if you want to learn a new language. With an ample choice of languages, you can pretty much learn any language you want. There is competition to keep you motivated which is great and if your friends join Duolingo, you can compete with them as well. The only problem I see in Duolingo is sometimes when you have to say the words of the language and you don't respond too fast, the audio will just mark you wrong. This may be a problem because of background noise or the system."", ""I think it's a great app, the way they do there adds is perfect, if it were any other way I would delete the app right away. I like that you have the option to have reminders on/off because I hate app reminders. (The following is an edit to the original 5 star review) This app is super buggy. It will allow you to have a 119 steak that your working on go to waste when it bugs out in the middle of a lesson and not allow you to continue. You'll have to restart your lesson after restarting the app."", ""I had trouble learning Spanish since high school. Duolingo has helped me so much. The lessons are broken down into short and engaging sections you can complete in under 10 minutes each. The characters are relatable and their notifications aren't intrusive. I don't usually spend money on apps, but I went ahead and bought the paid version for a year and it's worth it for the extras. I had the free version but I wanted the unlimited lives, extra lessons, and stories to open without spending coins."", ""I use to really love Duo, it was easy and accommodating so could go at my own pace. Unfortunately it's changed to a weird heart system where after so many chances; you have to WAIT to be able to practice again. This is a huge blow to someone who has disabilities memory and learning. I don't learn this way. If it's a tactic to try and get subscriptions I get it(kinda) but you're really hurting those who Want to learn and don't have the money for that sort of thing. Very disappointed"", ""I like this app. It does teach well, but I think it would be better if duo got rid of hearts. It's annoying having to wait another day just for my refill of hearts and practicing the same lessons to achieve more hearts. Everyone should have the option to practice with unlimited hearts but that's my opinion. Also one more thing that's irritating is the leagues. It's hard because your competing against a bot or duo plus people and it's hard trying to advance xp above them. Its very competitive."", 'Fun, and easy. Just sometimes extremely repetitive. I appreciate the idea this pounds the language into your head, but I feel like true immersion involves a broader use of the language than the same statements over and over and over. It would also be far more enjoyable and less drudgery, to log in and expect to learn something new instead of dreading saying the same 5 things repeatedly.', ""It is fun but I keep getting told that it is not a way to completely learn to be fluent. I am addicted to it. I like congratulating others to keep at it. I both like it and sometimes don't like it when they add changes. I got all the way to the second checkpoint when they determined that the second check point I was at should not be there anymore. It was very upsetting. I also kept the minimum amount for my streak to continue because I'm a mom and have busy distractions."", 'Huge fan. But PLEASE fix the way the program freezes, never to unfreeze. I am having to uninstall and reinstall constantly. This is a fabulous program. I am grateful because I have learned a lot from you. Update -- SIX months have passed. The screen freeze issue remains together with the need to uninstall and reinstall to get it working again. When this happens, the system loses my work from that day and falsely shows it as a missed day in my streak record. Hate that. Otherwise, I LOVE it!']"

Once sets are added through your desktop browser, it's a good app. When you are studying a large study set, don't navigate away from it for ANY reason - even to answer the phone. You have to start over EVERY time. Really frustrating when you get through 80/90 questions and you have to start over."", ""I think this app is very good especially for subjects where you have to memorize a lot of concepts. This app is especially useful for Anatomy, because Anatomy is full of difficult concepts, and there is plenty of information to memorize.

I would highly recommend this app to anybody!"", ""Quizlet is enjoyable to use.

My complaint is that it seems as if after you get past or close to around 100 terms, it becomes VERY laggy. It takes at least 10 seconds to go from one definition to the next term when typing them in. This causes a lot of frustration because the time that I have to wait for the cursor to go to the next thing adds up. All of my chapters have well over 100 terms each so this is something I have to deal with every single time I have a new chapter. I'm sure this wouldn't happen if I purchase the premium version, but I'm a broke college student that's just trying to study."", ""Cool flash cards, just what I was looking for.

It's a simple, easy program that makes studying so much better. However, the new update kind of took away most of the cool features and replaced them with ads for a premium option.

I personally have no problem with buying a premium feature, however, I know people who are students and can't really afford to pay for these things monthly."", ""I was confused at first, I usually use quizlet online. I thought that you had to pay for learning mode. I was upset, I downloaded the app and you didn't need to pay for it, it's free. You can pay for it if you want your custom study path. Also upset that when doing the learning mode, I think there should be a FREE option to put images for terms as well, or it can get confusing. That's all! The learning mode is the part that gets me excited the most to study! Having quizlet for 2 years! :)"", ""Quizlet is so helpful for studying vocabulary. Sometimes I make my own study sets but other times I use one that someone else made.

I wish they had a way to control the size so people with impaired vision could have large fonts while others have small fonts."", ""So theoretically, Quizlet itself is a great study tool. Having it on my phone is great, and it's easily worth the money. However as an app, I cannot believe that I'm paying for something that runs soooo slow. I cannot navigate this app at this speed.

The functionality is not."", ""It's a very useful app for studying or just learning in general. The one issue I think they have though is that the quizlet.live sessions aren't very stable, so there are frequent disconnects while playing with large amounts of people.

It makes flashcard making so much faster. And, now I don't have to mess with carrying index cards around. Great for anatomy courses, because you can use photos.

(3) You cannot sort the cards alphabetically in editing mode."", 'I love this app, and will be using it for a long time! It makes studying easier. The only thing that could be changed is the folders.

But this new version has removed functionality that has made it less effective. I credit previous versions of this for doing really well in my classes. I could study during a long commute because of the Play mode. I could study while rowing or jogging because of play mode. But it seems that the play option is gone. When you're a parent, you need to study when you can. Bring the play mode back! And landscape mode for flashcards!"", ""I'm preparing for my AP Biology class next year and Quizlet has made my life so much easier! I love it! The only complaint I have is on the actual Quizlet website, when I'm trying to study, these ads on the side of my screen are very distracting. I'll close out the ad but then a new one will pop up in less then two minutes. I understand that Quizlet needs to get their money somewhere--since it's a free learning tool--but it does get distracting."", 'I really love the overall simplicity of the application. i just wish that the testing format would allow for a little more room for error. For example I would sometimes use plural wording in my notecards and that would cause me to get a question wrong. Even with this issue though the app allows for you to select when you got a question right despite minor spelling errors so it is a very minor issue.', ""It's perfect for studying!!! I use it all the time for vocab and schoolwork. It's more than just flashcards, it's like having an interactive exposure to knowledge in a convenient and simple way.

My eyes now have to hunt for the translation of the word. As someone who's been using the app a lot, this is almost a breaking change. Please fix"", ""Like other reviewers I'm sorry to be finally writing a review like this after cancelling my subscription.  I used to really like Memrise as a handy and fun learning toll to keep my brain active by learning some Japanese and Spanish. It looked nice and I liked the space theme and calming blue colours. There were some things I'd have liked to see improved, e.g. more grammar, a list of all the content for a course instead of just each module, the ability to make your own modules from the words in the course rather than just flag difficult words, the ability to adjust the speed of the timed questions and time to review the response to your answer before it disappeared. But it was good. The new update is (a) hideous, and (b) broken. The black and yellow theme is awful and subconsciously aversive (like wasps). Some of the content is also now broken: you cannot scroll down the video on my phone to reach the letters you need to answer the question, which was not a problem before, so I just have to skip it! Some videos/questions also just don't load at all!  And it's going up in price?! No thank you."", 'As of now, I can only rate the free version. I am considering buying the yearly subscription, in part because of the good price ($3ish per month) but also because the app functions well, is easy to navigate, and the coursework is presented in a way that is easier (for me, anyway) to remember and use. Hearing AND seeing the native speakers has also been very helpful.', ""Pretty great overall as a learning platform, definitely one of the best if you go PRO. The free version will limit the level to which you learn a course, which is frustrating if you are trying to use this as a teacher with a classroom. Creating new courses still feels a bit primitive, but isn't too hard. One thing I would like to see change is the ability to browse and select courses in the app. Currently there is only a list of languages to choose from, and you need to visit the webpage to search through all subjects."", ""Was surprised to see any negative reviews about this app. I love Memrise and have subscribed for almost a year. Perfect for anyone that learns through memorization and repitition. I'll get on the treadmill at the gym and practice my Korean, the layout is so easy to use and you can turn sound off and still study. The new look really doesn't make a difference to me, still cute space stuff which is nice. I love the locals study, really fun and helpful to hear locals speak. Keep up the good work!"", ""I don't get the high rating. The layout is poorly designed and you're bombarded with offers to upgrade. Because of the design, its difficult to even figure out how to continue for free past three words/phrases. Maybe that's on purpose. Then about a dozen words/phrases in, the on screenini keyboard wouldnt accept any typing anymore to type the answer, so it's stuck. Thats a bug, I assume. I think I could do better learning from websites."", ""When you take away the new look Memrise is an awesome app for language learning. Being able the amount each lesson is extremely helpful if you're feeling overwhelmed. Enjoying features like the Locals, and being able to focus on difficult words or pronunciation. However, like I've seen already, the new look is a big turnoff for most people. Personally, it's too white and the green doesn't fit wherever you put it. Maybe try putting in a dark theme, that works well. Also change the flowers, yuck."", 'pretty good learning app. I also pair it with duolingo and switch off when I start getting annoyed/bored. Also, the dude they found for the beginner level of Japanese is just absolutely incredible. I laugh everything, which coincidentally makes it more memorable.

I'm having a very hard time following the menus and understanding how the lessons progress and what needs to be done or redone to advance. It's very busy visually and lacks organization and clarity.

By far the best Duolingo style app for coding. It's not gonna teach you how to be a senior developer for Microsoft just like Duolingo won't make you fluent in Spanish, but it will help you practice and cement certain ideas in your head.

It helps me review lessons I had a hard time understanding at first and it also helps me look ahead in lessons. I highly recommend purchasing the AFFORDABLE pro version!!!!', ""This is an incredibly challenging yet efficent app that I have started to use for learning all sorts of programming! One tip to newcomers that don't want to pay for the pro though, make sure to have a code editor open whilst using the app so you can test code without having to pay, also if there's a lesson you want to learn, but it costs bits just move on until you have enough from the free lessons!"", ""Straight up amazing. I've started the GoLang course, and I'm almost done with it within like 2 weeks of starting! It's amazing. I'm also quite experienced. This made it hard to find courses for me. But these courses are actually for everyone!!! Definitely recommending to everyone who I know wants to learn to code."", 'Great app to get into the basics. Some of the lessons lack information required to complete. Thankfully, the comments for each lesson are very informational and typically provide the right push to get an answer. Quite a bit of features require the paid Pro version. Seems like a worthwhile investment considering what coding knowledge can provide as far as income.', ""Pretty good overall! This app is easy to use and it has a lot of free content for many different languages. My only problem is that sometimes, a few of the test cases are behind paywalls. If I get something wrong, I wouldnt be able to figure what happened if I can't see the input or output."", ""I absolutely love this app. I am trying to learn Python from a hobbyist perspective to use on RPi projects.

Even the free version offers plenty of opportunity to practice. Love it!!!!!!"", 'It used to be this great app for practice. Now the app that aims to teach coding is ironically full of bugs both on the app and the web version.

The one thing I don't like is the heart system they just added, on the free version you can only make 5 mistakes in a session, which I really think is a bad feature. Learning is way less fun when you're punished for making mistakes."", ""Great for beginners. This is what I used years ago to get started. But it does kinda handicap you. Programming isn't hard, but this does hide a lot of more complex topics that may inhibit a learner from ever hearing about some topics. In other words, use it to get a basic understanding.

Highly recommended."", ""Out of all of the coding teaching apps I've used, this one seems to have the most options available to learn. The practice challenges can be a struggle at times. I've seen some challenges that started off with syntax errors and sometimes the IDE doesn't work as well as visiting this site on a computer.

For me, it would be better if the lesson and the ""try it yourself"" appeared in separate panes on the same page rather than linking to it and going back and forth, but the fact that you actually get the oppportunity ro try it rather than rolling through lessons and passing multiple choice tests aids in retention much better than most training apps in the same field.', 'This app is easy to use and learn from. The lessons are small in size so you can work on them at any time. The examples given are not extensive, but are sufficient (and probably more useful) being small for the tutorials. If more learning is needed, there are different options for learning more: a forum for each lesson, editable/executable code in an online environment, and more reading.

This app has tons of programming languages to learn, it's amazing. It's been only a few hours and my understanding of c# is much much better!

Amazing app, definitely use it if your trying to learn any programming language."", ""I love this App. I have been working on programming for a little while and I finally started taking formal classes Thanks to this app, I have a lot of experience and I am learning that I already knew the majority of the skills. There are a few shortcomings: certain lessons such as the algorithm lesson are incomplete, that is to say, they don't present concrete examples of how to implement the algorithms which left me fairly confused. There also seems to be a stigma that beginners are capable of creating somewhat complicated programs such as the challenge to turn a string of a date into a date that references a day of the week.

I create lists myself and have found workarounds, but it's annoying and I wish we could search by reading level only."", 'Love epic but the app has flaws. Having to log in every time you open it is a pain. The pane that pops up to show book progress while you are reading cannot be closed manually. So if you are using the app for children who who often touch the screen while they learn to read this pane makes it very difficult. Searching options need to improve with better filters. It is sometimes difficult to find an age appropriate book in a timely manner for your students. I could go on but out of characters.', ""This app is great! I like the variety of books available, though I hope the library continues to expand. The user interface is easy to navigate and I love being able to download for offline reading.

Add the ability to download the book from the non grid style list along with the available options, collection and/or favorite."", 'The books offered to read and explore are absolutely wonderful! The app works great. Sometimes it may stall. It gives you a warning in the beginning stating the the device used may not support the picture. Using a cell phone, it is working good.

It is a fun and productive way to pass time.', ""We like this app, however, there are issues with it. Sometimes when we save books for offline, they don't save. The app closes and freezes alot. This gets frustrating. We no longer live near a library, so this became a reading option for a family of avid readers. Unfortunately, the app doesn't always function well."", 'I would have given this a 5 star before the last update. But since then, you can no longer turn your phone screen off!

We have access to 6 different services for our kids to read. Of all of them Epic is the best so we decided to subscribe. It's easy to use and the kids are actually excited to read on Epic. The Android app: It works fine but is missing some key features. No way to download books or audio books for offline usage in the car. Also when playing an audiobook you can't use the phone for navigation."", 'Great app with one area of improvement, being the integration with Google Auto, ie. There is no integration.

My advice is to stay on the free side until they fix the upgrade issue and until they have the capacity to deal with their support tickets."", ""The best feature of this app by far is the appearance of the digital books, as compared with books on Amazon Freetime, which download slowly, and are hard to read until you double click the paragraphs, which is difficult to get right with a child, etc. Even the digital books on Libby are sometimes frustrating to read. Every book, audiobook, read-to-me books, and videos play seamlessly. The selection is excellent including books in Spanish! I also love that it's free to educators."", ""I LOVE this app. My daughter loves this app. The books are adorable, and there's even some of her favorites.

The one negative is that the number of books and the time spent reading are added incorrectly, reporting much higher than actual activity.', 'A lot of titles. Some have quizzes. I would recommend the app tag books with quizzes as well as make the reading levels filter more effectively.

Great concept, but needs a bit of work."", ""My child and I enjoy this app a lot! Lots of things to do and lots of books! The only thing I don't like about it has to do with the books that read to you. When the page turns, the voice that's reading will say the first word of the next page, but then it'll cut out. Once the page is turned it repeats the word again. It's annoying because it breaks up the book flow. Can this be fixed? At first I thought I had something wrong on my side, but a few of my friends had mentioned the same thing."", ""Great app but doesn't work normally , whenever you finish a book it doesn't count, sometimes you'd be at 105 books read and wouldn't get the badge for it.

Sometimes people get competitive about who's the highest level which is okay! A(nd not the apps fault.)"", ""I wish this app would work for us, I installed it for my kids 3 year old and 5 year old.

I don't see any option for filtering the books according to age, level of difficulty, or level of reading proficiency. So finding an appropriate book to read for my preschooler is a hit and miss. Also, the read to me option is not interactive at all, its like watching a video, not a reading experience. I want my kids to be able to read along, ie they should be able to follow the reader verbatim, and then flip the page at their own pace. I guess this app is not so suitable for early readers (pre-K or grade K)."", ""They must be about to shut this app down. There is no other reason for the rapid decline of this service. When we first signed up ~ 1 year ago, it was good. All books were good & age-appropriate for my 4 yo. She liked the badges & seeing the progress bar really motivated her to keep reading. Now it's a real piece. Most of the time it gets stuck on the loading screen, she's capped out at level 23. Progress bar is grayed out & there are no more badges to earn. Thereare no quality books anymore."", ""Epic app never works! On tablet or phone it forces you to download the app. Once downloaded it is sooooooo slow that it crashes every time.

Epic free doesn't seem to be available anymore even though they said it's available. I am so disappointed with this company. Thanks for wasting our time."", ""Love it!! I am a mother and all 4 of my kids use it. It's awesome that some of 4he hooks are read to you and the words are highlighted. It helps so much with my little ones and it has other books that you can read on your own. My kids use it when we are in the car and they just go from book to book.

The quizzes time-out sometimes, also selecting answers is annoying because it thinks you're selecting an answer when really you just want to see the next multiple choice option. Download to play later works better if you download when you have wifi and watch when you have shoddy internet. If you don't download and try to watch in bad internet... well, you won't. The buffering will take forever, the quality will dip, and you may have to re-watch the same section over and over. Basically, use wifi. If on the road, download beforehand. I also sometimes get the issue of watching a video and it not registering as being watched. Otherwise the content is very good."", 'If you are looking for beginner, intermediate or continuation training on almost anything you can think of, this is the app to use.

I'm working through multiple learning paths and need my notebook. Can't access notes or add new ones. That alone makes having the app pointless. I was hoping the app would make it easier to find my way into the learning paths but LPs, courses and video are mingled. Worse than the mobile site. Please go back to how Lynda had it. Tree format. LP/courses/videos. Let me drill down to the thing I'm looking for."", ""Don't want to give full 5 but better than 4. I like it has a lot of tech stuff I want and have added other important life lessons that can help anyone. What I think takes away a full 5 stars is they need to add an attribute to videos if the video can be only listened to as in it does not have nesscary visual information. This way you can search for them. I like to listen when doing other things but pointless when they are explaining how to do something and need to see it."", ""I'm sorry that some of you didn't get what you needed from your courses, but I had a really great experience with both courses I signed with.

I had more of an issue using the course on desktop."", ""I finish my courses in a learning path, but when I go to print my certificate it looks like gibberish. It is not clear what the certificate is for. Waste of time if I have no certificate to show for. *Update: I was contacted by LinkedIn Support and was given instruction to fix this issue.

I've tried numerous installs again with no difference. I really love LinkedIn Learning and would like more consistency with the app."", ""Works well but there are two issues. I have to wait a long time to access my downloaded videos when I'm offline; it leaves options blank until the app stops trying to access the internet. I know many deam android tablets dead but as a tablet user I would appreciate it if I could set this app in landscape mode at the very least."", ""In terms of usability Lynda was much better, especially the search feature. At the minimum stop listing random tiny modules from various courses when one search for some stuff, this does not add any value, rather the search should list down links to the 'whole course' sorted based on to what extent the searched keyword item is covered in the respective course. Course duration should not be more than 2hrs, ideally 1 hr or lesser."", ""This is by far the best online learning experience I have ever encountered! The extra tools available are very user friendly. Tag stuff you want to view again or skip sections you already know.

There's courses in here for everyone, you gotta try it!"", ""Horrible app. Downloads and videos hang when signal strength intermittently changes and never recover. Courses don't start playing even when partially downloaded. Search tool terrible- results are not selected or organized by topic. Search just pulls whatever courses that contain keyword as part of course information, so pretty useless because you have to sort through many irrelevant results. No intuitive course preview from search. i have to use this app for work and hate it."", ""The video screen is small. I think it's meant just for mobile phones, not for Chromebooks or large screens. I can't find a way to maximize it to fill the screen like the Lynda app and all other video training apps.

It works really well and has tons of educational, and professional courses to work throgh. However there is no transcript for mobil devices so I take notes accordingly.

Please correct so I can watch full screen horizontally on my Samsung S3 tablet. Thank u!', ""It's okay I guess.... It plays videos, but it doesn't allow you to download them in higher quality at least on my tablet which has the ability with other apps.

The app is easy to navigate and find what I'm looking for.

Sometimes it can be difficult trying to identify the path to travel. Otherwise -- great app.', ""This is a hub of all the required learnings for a corporate employee. It not only includes the corporate skill related courses but also the skills of personal development. One may find many advance courses for which it might have cost more anywhere else but luckily it's all accessible here in just a single subscription. Improvement Points: 1.There should be value like diplomas for some of the courses even by paying some extra cost. 2. It may tie-up with some recognised university.""]"

Very upset and disappointed in your app.', ""I used to love Skillshare. They had great creative classes and great instructors who are working in their industry. Unfortunately, their pricing structure has changed and requires an annual membership. I would love to be a loyal monthly customer or if they base their subscription on a 1, 3, or 6 month period. There are just long periods where I get super busy and can't take classes. I think as a business they are leaving a lot of potential customers out of the table."", ""I enjoy the classes but the app is a bit annoying. Sometimes lessons won't play until I force closd anc restart the app. Screen rotation is unpredictable. Downloads don't warn if K run out of space, they just quit playing already downloaded courses. No way to selectively delete individual lessons without removing the entire course. Still, I am finding lots of useful classes in my area of interest and feel the subscription is a great value."", ""The courses are good. But I think it would be beneficial to add that notification media control features. That way we don't have to open the app to fast forward or pause.

I enjoy the way they are segmented into small parts for easy management. BUT the skillshare app needs some work. It feels like a beta version. It's clunky and at times glitches out.

I often use it as a way to cast courses to my living room TV if I want to enjoy a class with my girlfriend or just want to get out of the office.

I wanted to learn different kinds of creative techniques and you can find it all, I usually watch it while my baby naps. The only thing I don't love about it, and actually hate, is how you cannot organize the classes trough your phone or tablet, they depend a lot on computers and that doesn't fit my life style, that is making me want to explore other learning apps, to see if one of them would offer a better interface..."", ""at first the app didnt recognize that my account was premium. I had set the skillshare account up on my laptop and wanted it on my phone when I'm not home. It had my account on premium but all the content was locked. I had to uninstall and reinstall for it to work but now it's great. I like the download feature because it's useful on airplanes and subways. I like that you can play at different speeds too which is great if someone talks very slow or rambles on before they get to the point."", ""I'm sorry to say, the UX of the android app is pretty bad. For example, after poking about quite a lot, I was unable to even change my profile picture. On the contrary, their website, even on a mobile browser is MUCH more usable. Here is an examples of my frustrations: - To browse by category, the user needs to scroll all the way to the bottom and then click on a dropdown menu. On the other hand a simple hamburger menu with categories would easily make the app much more usable."", ""Glitchy and hard to navigate. For all the classes available, this app makes it really difficult to explore options. You have to KNOW exactly what you want to learn, OR just be willing to start any old class and see what happens. But if you are interested in exploring a topic, the categories are just too broad. Plus, you can't access most of the course 'extras' and none of the documents, so say you want to learn to paint a dog in watercolor, you can't see the instructor's PDF sketches."", ""I love this app. I've been using my downtime to learn a lot of useful skills. I was going to try to just learn what I could during the free trial, but just ended up purchasing the year subscription. There's a lot of relevant content. I prefer their set up compared to udemy's. Rather than taking your chances on buying one class, you can try out a variety for one price."", ""Skillshare as a service is pretty legit as far as I can tell, I just have the free service for now as I browse the library. The app, however, is weird to navigate, and not particularly user freindly. It took me a bit to figure out how to search the catalog of classes & add classes to my list. Also, could use a night mode. The constant downward scrolling with the white background made me very motion sick even with my phone's brightness on lowest setting."", 'The service itself is awesome and has been very helpful in creating an environment of learning in my life. I have so many new things I know! The app could use a little work, mostly in the playback features. Sometimes the next lesson will just notnplay and i have had to reset the app to get it to work. Love the service, a little work on the app and this goes to five stars, easy.', ""Awful experience. I paid $99.99 for this service in 2018 and constantly found myself unable to access content because videos were locked in spite of me being a premium member. When I could use the app my saved classes constantly disappeared and video load times took forever because you can only watch in HD. Needless to say I stopped using it after a very short time. I have now been charged for another year subscription for 2019 because it apparently auto renews and have been denied a refund even though the app still doesn't work, I haven't used it, and I requested the refund within 24 hours of being notified of the charge. $99.99 is no small amount to lose for an app that isn't functional."", ""It's a fantastic app with some amazing tutorials. Definitely the best one on the market. The search option is pretty iffy if you're looking for a specific course, even typing the exact name couldn't find me the course, but I eventually found the one I was looking for anyway. Outside of that minor inconvenience the app runs great, looks great and is extremely helpful."", ""Let us have specific control over the video quality, holy geez. It's so freaking basic. Instead, I just have to keep rewinding 30 seconds and *hoping* that it decides to switch to a higher quality so that I can actually see anything. I often have to rewind 6 or 7 times before it decides to switch quality. Or at the very least, let us choose specifically which lessons to download, instead of having to download the whole dang class. Not all of us live in Silicon Valley with hyper fast internet."", ""Love Skillshare! For instructors, there could be some additions included for better structuring of content. For example, the ability to add sections in a course and the ability to add articles or attachments as course lectures. So some features could be improved so that teachers may be more effective in their teaching, but overall, it's an excellent platform."", ""The service looks good.  I haven't watch classes yet but they look like they will be good though.  However that app has one glaring flaw that is inexcusable in 2019 that makes the app itself 1 star automatically in my book.  You can not download videos to your SD card. At least I can't find a way to do it.  So you have to fill the device storage up with videos if you want to download them for offline viewing.  Making that feature pretty much unusable unless you have a basically empty phone as even a 36 min class is over half a gig.  Which is not surprising since HD videos are large files.  Which is why with competently made video apps you can download them to the SD card instead of the device storage.  If you could download the classes to the SD card it would be a 5 star app as the rest works well and is simple to use."", ""I haven't used any of the classes they offer YET, but I would like to rate this app 5 stars for the excellent customer service they provided! I was mistaken and didn't realize that after the free trial, I would be automatically billed their annual amount of $99. Immediately i was horrified and reached out to their CS with a simple email stating that I didn't mean to pay, and within an hour the amount was immediately refunded back to me. Thanks Skillshare for understanding and being awesome!"", ""Ok so I've had this app for a day thanks to GMM. I got 2 months free. So I tried it out... absolutely wonderful!! Love the courses. Easy to use. Lots of helpful stuff. Didn't realize there was so much stuff to do with my career/passion. Cinematography. Lots of camera and editing videos. Love it! Will most likely be paying for it once the 2 months run out. Only downside is it seems to take a bit to load. And I wish it had features like YouTube. Skip or back 10 seconds. And auto rotate.. but oh well. Still a good site/app"", 'So far, I am enjoying the couple lessons Ive done. However, the teachers have mentioned handouts or attachments and what not which I have not been able to find in the mobile app version. Also, on every class now, if I pause and move off the video to either another app or just to another page within skillshare once I go back to the class and hit play it wont play. I have to completely close out of skillshare and stop the running of the app totally and reboot before it will play again. Fyi.', ""At first I wasn't sure if the subscription fee would be worth it. I thought I would try the free trial and cancel before the due date. Wow, was I surprised. Skillshare offers a multitude of phenomenal classes. I find myself clicking this app instead of playing games. I have tried classes I never even thought I would be interested in. I love the variety of offerings and will most likely never get through my wishlist of courses. No glitches or lag time, the app runs flawlessly, love it!"", ""I've used skillshare for a little over a month now, and its one of the best investments I've made. I can learn anything I want with the click of a few buttons. Navigation could be a little easier, but its great overall. As far as it charging people for the service goes, its not Skillshare's responsibility when consumers can't handle their finances. I pay annually for my subscription and have yet to have any issues. People need to be more responsible. Excellent service though."", ""This app is Awesome! Has a ton of different courses on different subjects. Easy to use and understand. Can be interactive, sometimes the instructor urges you to start a project with them or apply what was taught within the course to a current project you're working on and to share with you're perfect on skillshare. Best of all you can go at your go at your own pace, no rush."", ""Great easy flow app & website, content is (generally) quality. I dont know if this is a thing with the app but the keyword search seems off, not pulling up things even if I typed in the title, also I don't think it has actual key WORD searches. The other mini problem is on the app it autoplays classes after the intro, which sucks if your slow /have a busy life. You kinda end up starting a class you don't want to."", ""I didn't know that I was on the lookout for something like skillshare for a long time, till I found Skillshare. This is one online learning app that opens all doors to learning at your convenience and at a very reasonable price. You do not have to pay for different courses separately. You just pay the annual subscriptions and you have access to myriad courses on a variety of topics. The instructors are top-notch and the way the courses are delivered is better than most I have seen. Great job!!"", ""Skillshare = Awesome! App Feedback: The courses never save/return where I'm at, the app always starts me at the first video, or some random spot in a video I already watched. The video player is also finicky. It doesn't always recognize what I touched (enter or exit fullscreen, play/pause, touch to open/close the overlay to see video options). And a recent bug from the Android 10 update, while I'm watching a fullscreen video and when the phone goes into battery saver mode the app glitches.""]"

I have to go back through and skip to the end of each video in a class so it registers I watched them all which is super annoying. 2- It's not easy to navigate to my saved classes that I want to watch."", 'The content is very educational and presented in well put together and easily digestible way, however the application format is very difficult to use. I would rate it higher if the app was more user-friendly, they make it difficult to find the class you had watched previously and even harder to re watch an episode, for it cuts out half of the titles and you have to be quick because it resumes at the last 3 seconds of the episode.

The love and excitement they have for their craft draws you in even if you don't share that passion. And if you do...Wow."", ""Content is okay. App is awkward. If you get off of the episode you are on accidentally, plan on five minutes to get back. Unhandy for walking. Loses place constantly.

This is supposed to be learning on the go. You better sit still and not touch your device."", ""The content is fantastic, the app is terrible.

The only reason I didn't give it a 5 was because the app doesn't get you to the right spot if you get out of the app suddenly.

Because I switch back and forth and everytime I switch back...it takes me to the wrong spot where I left off. I wish it had more playback features that YouTube has."", 'Overall, I have enjoyed Masterclass. The classes are highly narrative, and the degree to which they systematically ""teach"" as opposed to simply relating the instructor\'s perspective, varies quit a bit.

It doesn\'t always resume where I left off, so more time spent figuring that out than I would like sometimes. I plan to renew.', 'This app has exclusive content that I wanted to watch and am glad I did. But, the player leaves a lot to be desired.

This app is horrible. If you don't keep the video open and running it turns off. You can't lock your screen and continue listening. You can't use another app and continue listening.

From what I've seen so far, it's good. The app, on the other hand, is not covering even the basics beyond playing the videos themselves. - Doesn't remember where I stopped watching. - Doesn't remember what video I last watched. - No offline viewing. - Won't play with app minimized. Again, the contents so far seems good. Unfortunately, the app has completely killed my enthusiasm for masterclass."", ""I love having this app, but it needs work. I want it to have the functionality that is useful for people who are listening to the courses while driving or multitasking. We should be able to listen while using other apps. It should be able to be operated with my car like other apps (e.g., pause the class with my car's pause button). It should also pause when my GPS talks (other apps do this). This would all be so helpful."", ""I really like the content in the app. All the classes I have watched have given me an insight into the subject I was studying. The reason I am giving 4 stars is because when I receive a call, plug in my phone or minimize the app, the app resets to the video I began my 'session' watching. And when you're 10 videos in that can get rather annoying. However the content is helpful it's just a minor annoyance when trying to watch a lot of videos at one time."", ""I love the courses, but the app could use some work. I wish there was a way that the main list would somehow mark which ones I've completed. Also, when watching several classes back to back it doesn't update that I've finished the lesson, it will show that the last 30-50 seconds wasn't watched, which is just enough that it won't move the class to the finished list.

I read some of the one star reviews and can't say I've run into any of the technical issues other seemed to be having. No lag, no errors, no crashes, no troubles using it. The app is easy, and straight forward. The subscription is pricey, and most of the classes seemed to be intended for people perusing creative outlets. I have taken afew of the classes and while most are for people who are past the beginner stage of the topic, there is abit of a range. 5 stars"", 'Great, easy to use app. The interface is quite well done, however there are a few small glitches: when coming back to a particular course, the app doesn\'t always hold your place correctly (it will think that you are a few lessons behind where you actually left off).

I'd like to think of myself as a creative mind and I couldn't pick just one class. Honestly I love it, I use it almost daily (it's been about 3months total). I just finished the Tom Morello course, and currently in progress over several other music, film, cooking courses now. Properly dedicating time to the workbook and topics will show results."", ""The reason that this review gets 3 stars instead of 5 is that there are bugs in the app. Particularly if you want to use the app to go back and rewatch a lesson. The lesson loads then ends and moves onto the next unplayed video. You do not have the ability to either reset the episode to the beginning or move the scan bar to the beginning so you can rewatch it. This is a serious issue for me especially because I like using the app instead of the website because it is the only one that can cast to google chrome directly. The classes are fantastic, especially Chris Voss's negotiation one. Be sure to watch his youtube videos and read his book as well!"", ""The content is good, but the app sucks. There is no ability to do full screen, so I'm stuck watching it on the top of my screen. If I leave a lesson, it will resume at that lesson, but it start it over from the beginning. There is also no way to listen to this while using other apps. If I exit out of masterclass, i lose my spot and the video stops playing. It needs to be more like the YouTube app and move to a corner and continue playing. There should also be a podcast feel to it for car play."", 'This review is of the app itself, and not the content of the courses offered. The app is clean, well organized and mostly free of flaws. Flaw 1: If you have watched a video before, clicking on it again takes you to the end and then auto plays the next session. This provides some irritation in watching a session over easily. Flaw 2: An inability to minimize to the background and listen in a podcast esque way. It would be beyond useful to listen to some lessons over again as sound only.', ""I love the program but this app needs work. First, it won't play it you navigate away, so even if you aren't watching the video and just listening, the video must remain open. If you do navigate away from the video, it will not remember where you were. Sometimes it starts the lesson over, sometimes it jumps to another lesson entirely. Pretty basic stuff that doesn't work."", ""The service is 4-5 stars, the classes are great, customer service is also pretty solid. The app is closer to a 3 though. The app looks good, and doesn't crash from what I've seen. So it functions. Aesthetically the app looks really nice.

Fix those two things and it's an easy 5 stars"", 'I have enjoyed the classes so far. Such a relaxed setting to learn about things that interest me. I just wish there was an even greater diversity of classes to choose from. More science/technology, computer programming/engineering, brewing, organizing/minimalism/etc. All in all it is a wonderful experience, and hopefully with time the subject matter will continue to expand.', ""I believe the app is better than the web version. Easy to use, easy to find what you have yet to complete, simplistic interface. Even so, it's not perfect. The 'cancel' button to cancel auto play doesn't work, and going back when trying to do the end surveys causes issues. However, I am still pleasantly surprised that those are the only real issues I've ever had with this app. The website has way more issues, mostly with freezing and video playback. More people should use the app. :)"", ""I just sent this to Masterclass help: 12/13/19 Dear MC, There is a major bug that needs to be fixed. When using MC through the app, if the app is paused for say text/telephone/internet/photos, when one resumes play, the app restarts over the class. But it doesn't just restart over, if you are more than one class in, it goes back to the beginning. I'm not sure if it's the beginning of that day, or the whole beginning. This bug has already been mentioned by other people in the app reviews of the playstore, so I'm not sure why it hasn't been resolved or even exists. When I use my app Audible for example, I can still listen to it even though I might be texting or taking pictures. This is HUGE bug. I ended up listening to the same class 5x yesterday because of this bug!!!!!!! Please email me about this."", ""Wonderful resource and teaching tool. I highly recommend Masterclass. Wonderful way to learn and grow one's skill base. I enjoy the variety and expertise of the instructors. Great that it works around your schedule. Many of the class instructors offer workbooks and assignments that can easily be downloaded and printed if desired. I'm new so haven't gotten the opportunity to explore the network aspect but it's good that it's offered. It's worth the membership. I highly recommend it."", ""TLDR; cancel your subscription well in advance of the end if you don't plan to renew. This is not a new issue, as you can see by looking at other one/two-star reviews. Gave a Masterclass as a gift and that year ended. However, it wasn't so clear that the receiving individual needed to cancel their own subscription or be charged. Finding the button to cancel my own subscription wasn't easy either -- I had to log in 2x to find the button BURIED."", ""Video Player is Frustrating. I thought it might be an improvement over the online player, but it doesn't look like it is. The app does not keep a phone (OnePlus 6t in my case) from going to sleep, and sometimes when the app closes or is minimized for any reason, such as calls or screen timeout, you get taken all the way back to second one of the very first video in the series you're watching. The videos are wonderful but the player and app are missing basic capabilities."", ""App is terrible. I like MasterClass so far, but as a person that does a lot of tutorials, the mobile UI on this is subpar. Every phone I've used in the last 10 years has the ability to turn the screen and use it full screen for videos. But this app keeps the video teeny-tiny in vertical orientation only. The video is 1/4 of my screen!!! And the rest of the screen just is filled with a description of the class (not useful after you have read it once), and a list of other videos you can click on. Every TV/Movie streaming service allows the full screen option. Learning apps like Pluralsight, Udemy, LinkedIn Learning, etc - allows full screen option. But this app is barely usable for it's main purpose because of the limitations. MasterClass has such wonderful high-profile teachers, they deserve a comparable app."", 'I want to start off by saying the classes are fantastic, the app itself is what deserves two stars. Not having the ability to download videos ahead of time severely limits when and where I can watch videos, making the whole service much less useful to me. The quality of the video player is not great, pause/play has issues before and after the video, when it is loading, etc. Overall the app offers very little functionality beyond a video player.', 'The content is great. The app has poor functionality. I have to stumble around to find what I\'m looking for. They keep showing you featured instead of ""my list."" Also, when I\'ve completed a course, it\'s still saying incomplete. Also, the course needs to be optimized for folks who listen in the car. Having typed subtitles does not help for car listeners.', ""Really enjoying Masterclass, but the app functions poorly. The app regularly loses track of where I'm at in videos and jumps back to the start of the course. If i am interrupted during a video and have to pause and come back later, the app rarely picks back up in the right spot. Sometimes it will also show that I'm watching one lesson while actually playing the video for another lesson. Working from a computer is really the only way that the classes are worthwhile in my opinion"", 'The content is great, but the app needs work. Each time I return to the app, it asks if I would like to pick up where I left off, but it never returns to the right spot, not even the right lesson. I stop watching lesson 9 at the 6 minute mark, and when I return it wants me to watch lesson 6 from the starting frame. It would also be a nice addition if I could cast to my smart TV. It does cast, but only gives the option to cast to certain devices in my home, none of which are my TV or Roku.', ""4.75, having trouble with playing videos in landscape, but aside from that I absolutely adore how user friendly this is! I know the price is a little steep but for the variety of classes from such a large group of people is worth every penny. Each class has bite sized videos that are thought provoking but not too long so you really absorb the content of one before moving on to another. Love the work books also! They're so helpful when trying to really delve into the discussed topics."", ""I've only had the add and membership for about a day. However, I can't stop using it. I like to be a jack of all trades kind of person, with specialties in a few catagories, but thanks to this app, I can learn loads of different subjects. The application is very fast, no bugs and a strong visual video. You can favorite your teachers/classes so you can already open what you want. Yet, I think the most valuable portion is far are, obviously, the lessons. So far, worth the money. Excited for more.""]"

Secondly, I also find it annoying when they keep trying to get you to buy the toolkit when I keep rejecting the offer. Lastly, when the lesson is completed you are supposed to be able to complete a quiz and turn in your assignment, but they are both locked. From my understanding, the lessons should take an hour, mainly 30 minutes of information and the other should be spent completing the assignments. If the assignments are not going to be open then it just wastes your time.

'Ad blindness' comes to mind, a term I recently learned while doing the Digital Marketing course on here... As for the content- I have only completed my first week of classes for two courses I am doing. So far it has been decently informative and helpful, although sometimes the classes come off more as recordings than interactive courses. Also for one of my classes I had a different 'instructor' on the second lesson and I would of liked to keep the one I had in the first lesson to have some consistency.

The slides that play during class are also very helpful!"", 'I was extremely excited to dive into learning more about data analysis but this course is disappointing at best. The additional packet of information they charge for is NOT worth the purchase. It contains nothing more than the word-for-word script used during ""class"".

Wondrium - Learning & Courses,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tgc.greatcoursesplus&hl=en&gl=us,"['Can\'t say I\'m thrilled with the app. Yes, it allows you to access your Great Courses stuff (the primary function is fine). It does not allow for screen rotation, so video presentation is limited to whatever the width (not length) of your screen is. It has an option for audio only, so you can cut back cell data usage while you\'re just listening. While using cell data, it also unexpectedly pauses, skips, and decides that you\'re done with a lecture while there are still several minutes to go. I haven\'t noticed this with WiFi data, but also haven\'t given it a thorough testing. Probably the second-most annoying part is that the app wants to launch every time I unlock my phone. I have absolutely no idea why. TL;DR? Sure you\'re going to be able to get your Great Courses stuff. Aside from that, it needs a lot of work. I\'d say ""one star, would not recommend"" except that the primary function works.', 'I LOVE the great courses. However, their apps have been lagged and not well designed. One good example is that I have to click individual episodes and download them. The app designers could have provided an option to download an entire course with just one click. Also, it is hard to know if a download has started or not. Wondrium app is still buggy and laggy. Hope it soon falls into the hands of good developers and designers', 'The library of courses from The Great Courses is great to have, but this mobile app is lacking in two quality of life features and fixes that would make it great. The first one is playback continuing after turning off the phone or putting the phone on standby. Both audio and video playback stop after pressing the power button to turn the display off. Audio playback continues for a few minutes and then stops. Video playback stops immediately. The second is keeping captions on downloaded videos.', '06/25/2021: Video plays for only a few seconds, then stops- as if ""paused"". To resume playing I have to click the video and press the ""play"" icon. Then it plays a few seconds and pauses again. This infuriating behavior occurs for both live streaming and downloaded video playback. This doesn\'t happen on the iPad, only on Android on my Samsung Galaxy S9+. Update: 02/12/2022. No resolution. This apps completely sux on Android, and no help from Wondrium. Just lame responses.', ""The content is fantastic but there are some minor complaints. I wish there was a way to see subcategories of subjects. I also would like it if there was a feature that allowed me to view the introductions to various courses in quick succession, sort of like an educational version of TikTok. It'd be a cool way to explore different courses without having to manually search for everything."", 'If I could leave zero stars, I would. Since becoming Wondrium we can no longer stream through Roku to use our subscription or access our previously purchased great courses. We tried reloading, changing the password, etc. Nothing worked. We contacted customer service. They apologized for the inconvenience, confirmed that we had paid our subscription and it is paid for the next 3 months (quarterly billing plan) but offered no help in fixing the problem. Used to be a good service, now it is a scam. Nov 17th Update: Thank you for trying to help. Yes, we knew they were two different Roku channels. When you go to the Great Courses the channel tells you to go to the Great Courses Plus channel. Then when you try to load Great Courses Plus, Roku says there is no such channel. The Great Course Plus channel is what we had that worked fine, until it switched to Wondrium.', ""Basically gives you free college courses on your own time from home! If you call Wondrium (before signing up) they'll give you a code to pay 1/2 price forever! Works on my Roku, firestick, & Android.

New courses always being added, a favorite list, & great search option. A+"", ""I like this service. There doesn't seem to be another like it. While other learning apps focus on career advancement, this app is for people who just like to learn new things. I was one of those weird people who enjoyed being in class more than partying while at college, and this service captures what is like to be in class. I really enjoy being engrossed in lectures by professors who are knowledgeable and passionate about what they teach."", ""Why is the quality so bad? Video quality seems to cap at 720p, which honestly is fine for me, but the audio sounds so bad most of the time. There is no question that there is a great wealth of information here, if you can grit through it. It's like Audible quality, tuned smartly for voice to sound okay at low bandwidth, but distractingly bad when you notice it. It also keeps telling me I'm not on wifi and interrupting my viewing when I def am on my home wifi. The constant popups say otherwise."", ""Content: 5 stars. App performance: 0 stars. Trying to cast from my phone to my Vizio TV with Chromecast/Google Assistant built in fails. On courses with the audio option it plays the audio, but on video-only courses it refuses to play. On my TV. 😒 I'm paying for this subscription specifically to use in our homeschool, so only watching it on my phone is NOT a viable option."", 'I was a heavy user of the previous version of this app and it was great! I love The Great Courses Plus and the app was simple but effective. Now the new version, I\'ll admit, is certainly more aesthetically appealing. Being able to collapse different course titles in the ""Downloads"" view is helpful, and I like having quick access to the PDF course guides. However, this version also took a few steps backwards: 1) Why can\'t we store videos on SD card anymore? Will TGC bring that back or has it been permanently removed? The videos take up a LOT of space and I was running low as it was. 2) Now all videos play with the status bar and button bar permanently visible instead of in full-screen view. Could you please at least provide a setting so users can choose whether they want full-screen or non-full-screen playback? 3) Whenever I\'m downloading a video for offline playback all the images on the screen start flashing. Not a problem but annoying and looks unprofessional.', ""2020-04-16 (revised to 3 stars) The folks at Great Courses Plus are obviously working on improving the user experience and have made a significant progress over the past 2 weeks. The latest version of the app (version 5.2) times out less frequently and hasn't crashed on me yet. Therefore, the original 1 star review is no longer warranted. There is still room for improvement, but kudos to TGC for the progress so far. 2020-04-04 (original review) The 1-star review is for the new release of the Android app and the lack of support for it. First general problems: The app hangs, crashes, and will go into spinner mode until you exit and restart it. This happens multiple times daily. And when it's not doing those things, it can be painfully slow. I suspect much of the slowness is due to a new back-end system implemented by the Great Courses. Things have gotten substantially worse after the upgrade to the new system (when all of the device passwords were reset). Specific bugs: 1) Speaking of passwords, the Android app has a 20 character limit for the password, even though the website will allow you to configure a longer password. There's no warning about this website. I had to figure it out the hard way. 2) The app allows you to download content so you don't have to stream and incur data plan charges. But inexplicably (I think because they never tested this), when you start to play downloaded content while not connected to wi-fi, you get a pop-up warning you that you need to change settings to allow data streaming because you're not connected to wi-fi. But this is the whole point of downloading content. And if you try to exit popup, you have either changed the setting (which I don't want to do - I downloaded the content because I *don't* want to stream over my data plan) or you haven't changed it and playback stops. So I just leave the dialog open and then app eventually crashes once I'm back in wi-fi range. Great... I haven't received a response to any of my recent attempts to contact Customer Service. As a long-time customer of The Teaching Company / The Great Courses (since the time when courses were sent out on cassette tapes) this is disappointing. They used to have very good, responsive customer service. It's a shame because the app and customer service are so bad that I'm ready to cancel."", ""I love the Great Courses, and based upon the content, I was planning on extending past the 30 day trial. However, I'm not sure I will. On my Samsung phone, it pauses every couple of minutes and gets really annoying to keep pressing play. This could be very dangerous for those that try to listen and drive. Also, on my phone, I have to exit the app a couple times in order for my content to appear. The roku app won't keep you signed in so it takes a while to sign in and it's really annoying."", ""The content is great. The app is a little slow and buggy sometimes but that's not a huge deal. The problem I had was strange and was never resolved. I did the free trial with intensions to renew and pay full price the next month. The next month rolled around and I was charged for the subscription, but my account was deactivated. I emailed the team to try getting this figured out and they still haven't fixed this. They refunded me, and they told me they'd fix it but it's been almost a month."", 'The app loses all my information llike Favorites or Downloads when it remains dormant for a period of time. I have to kill the app and restart it and it then remembers everything. In the past I had trouble accessing downloaded courses when I did not have an internet connection. It wants to reverify that you are an active member. I have not tested the latest version. Other than that, the app is great!. Finding, accessing and streaming a huge range of courses.', 'I love the material offered by The Great Courses, but the app has some issues. 1. Several days ago, I downloaded some lectures to listen while on a trip with limited internet access. Upon opening the app, I was greeted with the message ""We have made some changes that require you to upgrade to our latest version"" with no option to continue until the app was upgraded. Very annoying, and kind of defeats the whole purpose of downloading lectures. 2. During playback of lectures, the player will randomly pause, requiring me to manually restart. 3. No Android Auto support for audio lectures.', ""It's nice being able to take the courses with you on the go. The audio-only option allows me to listen in the car during my commutes. My only issue is I wish the size of the closed captions was adjustable. It is so teeny tiny on my S9 that it's pointless to try to use them. I don't really use this app as much as I would like because of this. I have a slight auditory processing issue and watching things with captions is very helpful for me."", ""Update: I added a star. The app is no longer struggling to load and play audio and video. Previous: The app itself is nice. But it really seems to struggle with audio and network interruptions - phone and sms. I've had to go as far as force stopping and purging local content to get it running normally again. It's unfortunate because it makes the product hard to enjoy."", ""Love the great courses but the app is terrible! Every single time I try to go back to where I left off it locks up, just loading forever. Occasionally I can do a search but cannot use the back button so no way to navigate to the menu, I just have to restart the app and loading in general is very slow so I'm never quite certain if I need to wait it out or restart. Once I actually get to the lectures playing audios/videos seems to work well."", 'The service is awesome but this app is an exercise in frustration. I will start a lecture and listen as I clean the house but invariably playback will stop and I have to pull out my phone, pause, then play again. It also never goes on to the next lecture without me having to do the same. It often stops playing new lectures altogether after two or three. Then I have to actually kill the app and restart it. This happens when downloading the lectures, too. It is pretty to look at, but I wish they had put more effort into smooth, reliable operation.', ""Best new feature: you can now download lectures in audio and listen offline. (Before, you could only download video lectures.) The app now marks your place in each lecture, even if you skip between lectures or courses. It now freezes much less often. If it gets wonky or slow, try restarting your phone. If you need to pause for more than a few minutes, quit the app and restart it when you're back. If you press play after pausing too long, it drops you at a random point in an earlier lecture."", ""Excellent value for the money. I listen to lectures in audio format when I'm driving for work and watch the videos when I have time at home. Seamless transitions between the two make it possible to keep up no matter what you're doing. I've learned so much thanks to these guys from Great Courses and Wondrium is just a step up in content. The only downside is poor app integration across devices. Don't count on seeing this on flex boxes, game consoles, or some other streaming devices."", ""Great content. Horrible app. Audio courses will play for 20 seconds and then stop so you have to keep pressing play every 20 seconds to get through the lecture. I thought the newest update would fix this, but it actually made it worse. Too many times I've opened the app to listen to a course and it simply wouldn't load. For a few days the app said I wasn't a member and didn't have access to the content. Really disappointing. I paid for a 3 month subscription and can't access anything."", ""There's so much content, and such a wide variety of lectures and courses to choose from along with guidebooks. Another awesome feature that's extremely useful for me is the ability to quickly switch from video format to audio format whenever I have to go somewhere or do something. My only recommended improvement would be to add something like a monthly credit to buy a singular lecture or course, and own it forever. Similar to Audible. All in all, great app. Recommend it a lot. 👍"", 'I love the Great Courses and was excited to subscribe to the Great Courses Plus. The content is excellent and the app is nicely designed. Unfortunately, I am unable to actually watch any video using the App. I have an app that runs in the background and updates information on my pull down menu every 5 minutes. Every time it updates, this App pauses the video or audio that is currently playing. Please try to fix this. If the app would automatically resume playing, it would be better. Thanks', 'The updated app includes the ability to download audio versions of each lecture, plus the associated guidebook. These are terrific improvements over the former version. Moreover, the functionality and user interface are great. However, I would still like to see the capability to download all lectures in a course with one button instead of clicking on all individually.', ""I really do not like this app. When it works it works well. When it screws up it does a great job! If your multi-tasking with this app you can forget about it. I paused my lecture, used GPS for around 15mins then went back to lecture and my lecture was gone. I had to restart and it doesn't restart from the beginning but it also doesn't restart from where it was initially paused either. That problem is bothersome but the app will aslo go as far as freezing up and will become unresponsive."", ""I like all the content the app has, however it's a little buggy. If I'm locking my screen , I can pause the app from the lock screen. However, if I click play from the lock screen, Not only does the course I want to listen to play, but also some random course I was listening too previously also starts playing. It's a little frustrating to have to open the app each time I want to resume my course"", ""I love the courses (selection and content), but the platform is terrible. I stream the courses at home and in my car. If I don't remember to open the app before leaving home, it does not recognize my ID and password when I try to use it in the car. When away from home,, I can't close the app because I have the same problem. Some of the older courses don't have an audio only option which uses more data if you stream them in your car. All the courses should have an audio only option."", ""The app used to be pretty bad and had a difficult to use UI. Also couldn't delete individual downloaded lectures, you had to delete a whole course of downloaded lectures. All these issues are now gone and the app runs much more smoothly now after an update that came out a late last year. Only thing I can think of that needs to change is making all lectures available for audio download, as I think there are still some that are available for video download only."", ""The content is wonderful. The app is not. It rarely remembers where I am in a lecture series, both within a given lecture and where I left off between them. It says that you can save the lectures to your SD card, but you can't. Also, the opening screen should be my watchlist, not some random collections of lectures in which I have no interest."", ""Edit: reduced to 1 star. After more than 2 years and hundreds of hours of lectures, I'm removing the app and canceling my subscription. Audio streaming has been failing to load with increasing frequency over the last year, and has now become entirely non-functional. Same issue on iphone X and Samsung S20+. Verizon, tmobile, wifi, all the same. I have one course to finish in video mode and I'll be canceling my subscription, and it's a real shame."", 'As the others said, the content is great. The lecturers are good, and the topics are many and interesting. The applications (be that on Win 10, Fire or Android) leave a lot to be desired. There is no consistency across the board (which happens when someone hires different contractors to build them without having an overall standard), and unfortunately the android app is just useless in my case because I cannot listen to the lectures, only watch them. Cancelled my subscription after an year.', ""Great content let down by a bad app: * You can download content, but you must be online to access (why bother?). * You cannot download audio only for many lectures, leading to needlessly big downloads/data. * When you download the video and let your screen sleep, the audio stops. * There's no easy way to see where you left off. * Way too much focus on video for what is great audio content. * No Android TV support at all. All in all, there's a lot that feels poorly thought out and woefully executed. The inability to play content offline is absurd. All the major streaming services have that figured out, but here it's a mess. I still kinda recommend the overall product, but the app makes it absolutely painful. It's a mess."", 'Good content. Greatest problem is that you cannot download the audio of a video course. Thus you have to stream it if you are away from wifi; not good if you have a limited data plan. Downloading the video and playing it later would work but for my battery being more quickly depleted by playing the video just to listen, not watch. May quit when my free trial is up.', ""This app has been amazing, there are so many learning opportunities. I've been listening mainly to history lectures as I work from home but there is so much more I'd love to dive deeper into when I have time. There was recently an issue where my subscription was canceled without my input but they helped me sort that out. Something to do with Google play, not the apps fault. Point being, they have always been very helpful to me when I need it."", ""TL;DR Wonderful learning tool if the audio playback worked consistently. App content has been great so far, but it's good I'm on a free trial because the audio playback is buggy. I drive truck so I want to be able to listen to audio in the background, but I often can't get it to start playing... The loading spinner spins and spins, but no audio. If I choose video, it normally starts in ten seconds or so, but then it stops playing when I send the app to background. It's an irritating Catch 22."", 'If you installed the upgrade that was pushed out on 2/12/2020 and are stalled at the sign in screen (just a spinning circle and the words, ""Signing In""), try going first to the ""Browse Courses"" option at the bottom of the screen and then use the sign in button that is available there. That was the only way I could get past the stalled ""Signing In"" screen that came up whenever I tried to sign in directly from the starting screen. Love The Great Courses Plus. Still room for improvements to the mobile app, but they\'re working on it.', ""The content is genuinely top-notch (I'm often quite surprised by the production quality) and had a wide variety of topics to choose from. The app is a little slow and sometimes buggy, but I expect it'll improve in time. Pricing is kind of expensive, but they're making new courses regularly so it doesn't seem like such a waste to me. I'm overall very happy with Wondrium."", ""Fantastic but dated. Catalogue is huge and the speakers well selected. My only complaint, and unfortunately it's a big one, is how dated all these lectures are. The ones I've listened to are all from the 2000's. Much has changed and been discovered since than. I'm left to wonder how come these arent being rerecorded every few years. Even once a decade would be in improvement.""]"

Which is kindof fair as it requires money for the things they are presenting, but education should be free. If you want to learn anything from this app, you need MONEY.', '850 TK for 3 months of subscription; sometimes things that are just too good to be true, actually are true.

But most of the features seems to be in building process like past year Qbanks & some major updates are needed, like playing the videos in the app, it gets stuck or keeps buffering. Overall its worth the purchase. Great job"", ""Many of the questions do not have a proper solution given, only the answer is mentioned. The aim is to understand the topics, right? I don't think it is possible to understand a topic clearly if only the answer is given rather than the whole solution in detail. I sincerely hope that this problem would be fixed."", 'Was having some technical issues but the team personally contacted me and fixed it in no minute.
