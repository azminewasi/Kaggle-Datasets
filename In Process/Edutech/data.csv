Tap the Tips icon next to certain skills to get helpful explanations of grammar, pronunciation and useful phrases. Now available in our Spanish, French and Chinese courses, with more to come!","[""I love using the Duolingo app! Super convenient for on-the-go language learning, I can easily complete a lesson whenever I have a spare minute or two throughout my day. I like that the app utilizes various methods of learning, including listening, reading, and speaking. I also like being able to turn off the speaking option for short periods of time, especially if I'm working on a lesson in a public space and can't talk out loud."", 'Edit: One new issue arises the more I learn Spanish. It will introduce old words as new, and not introduce some new words as new at all. I have no reason not to love this! My only wee problem is that some audio is so quiet while some is loud. If I am in a public place or around others and trying to be considerate, I have to constantly mess with the volume. This I could easily fix with headphones, yes, but I dont have any at this moment. Just a thought. Loving it regardless!', ""I'm reviewing my Spanish and learning Scottish gaelic along with a tiny bit of latin.. the app is easy to use and fun. I've noticed the spanish is much more built out than the gaelic with things like word matches, speech correction and even separate stories that are really cute. There is even a spanish podcast with available transcripts on the website which is exceedingly well done. Unfortunately the tips that go along with each new lesson set are only available on the website, not in the app."", 'I loved this app it worked so well. It was fun and encouraging. Two complaints about this app are not being able to draw the letters in another language because I have a English keyboard and can not type the ""correct"" letters and the fact that I was supposed to have had a 38 day streak. For whatever reason I lost my streak at 36 even though I was doing lessons and never got my points for the last 2 days. I have lost interest because they have yet to contact me back.', ""I'm using it to brush up on my French. Makes it super easy to practice and there are several anti frustration mechanics to keep you going when you mess up. I wish they focused more on the feminine and masculine aspect of french. When they teach a noun, they skip out on the article which makes recalling them difficult later. The stories are a great addition to the app! One problem. I listen to it on my commute. Please have it save the progress locally because it doesn't save without service."", 'A great app to learn. There are certainly places where I can see that there are places for improvement but it\'s good. For example some of the ""wrong choices"" for pictures should have translations so we can get used to them beforehand. There are often fill in the blanks that aren\'t sounded out and there\'s no speaker button. The speaking part is very weak. We don\'t get to practice pronunciation often. If there\'s any background noise, it\'ll tell us to wait 15 minutes.', ""The app itself is great. I make tons of progress,but this isn't without the help of my friend from France. I feel like there should be lessons thoroughly explaining grammar rules and other important things. My friend helped me, and I think I would have struggled solely using the app. I also find the heart system frustrating because it makes you end a session with errors instead of ending a session foxing them. A translate feature would be nice, too; for words, the lessons don't teach."", 'Duolingo is a convenient way to learn a language that is always ready when you are. New words and concepts can be introduced suddenly, but are reinforced through repetition and quickly become part of your repertoire. Sometimes the repetition can seem excessive, which seems to limit ability to move on, but it seems to be warranted to internalize the new information. On occasions, the speaking back function seems to refuse to acknowledge acceptable responses (a glitch?) with repercussions.', ""An amazing app for learning a new language. Easy to use, fun, accessible, and short lessons let you do quick lessons in moments of free time. I've learned so much over the years I've used this. They stay updated and add new features. Limited ads for the free version do not ruin the experience or make you feel you HAVE to pay to get the desired effects. Amazing app, definitely recommend"", ""First, one star off for no way to report bugs in the app. Second star off for a bug worth reporting. This has been a pretty good app, until a couple of weeks ago. I used it for Spanish a couple of years ago, now Chinese for a year. All of a sudden the text in the buttons has the bottom third cut off. Both pinyin and simplified characters. This vastly reduces the effectiveness of the app for learning. I'll switch to another until this bug is fixed."", ""Decent, but I wish there were better ways to review words you've leavened considering reviewing and repetition is an integral part of learning a new language. You have a list, but I wish when you clicked on a word you learned, it offered the definition and verb conjugation. I think I'll just have to have a notebook on hand during the lesson and write my own verb tree immediately (which is also important so I don't mind that) or you'll miss it. I tried to find a forum, but Duolingo deleted all."", ""This review is for the Korean course. The course has improved significantly since I first started and is a lot more immersive now. I still wish all the new words in each lesson were introduced at the beginning of the lesson instead of as they come, but I can live with that. What I can't live with, and what makes this lose 2 stars is the leaderboard. I would pay for duolingo if you could opt out of the leaderboard. I hate the added pressure it gives and want it gone. I won't pay until it happens."", 'It\'s good for practicing recall, but when you get beyond the basics you\'ll realize that the translations they\'re giving you for certain sentences are approximations not exact translations, which is frustrating. For example they gave me a sentence in German that literally translates to ""The library is in the vicinity"" but ""in the vicinity"" wasn\'t an option I could select to build the sentence, so I had to select ""nearby"". My brain doesn\'t work like that, I need the exact translation.', ""Genuinely a quality language learning resource. Free version has ads; you can pay a subscription to go ad-free. I didn't realize this when I first downloaded it and paid for a year because I thought I had to, but honestly thought the price was good for the quality of the product. Using the free version now, an ad plays at the end of each lesson, but are less obnoxious than some apps I use"", ""Overall the app is pretty good. However, that being said there's a lot of room to improve. First, I'm not 22 and find the whole game like experience annoying and condescending. I don't need points, gems, hearts etc. I would prefer statistics and quantified measurements. I would certainly consider a paid version but nowhere can I find the cost and features listed. I'm not going to buy anything unseen. Providing downloadable vocab lists and progress stats would be a great reason to pay."", 'App is great most of the time!! It is impossible to talk to a person and I have easily lost 1000 credits using a streak freeze when I completed the excercise on the same day!! This may seem menial but it had cost me many hard earned points and I dedicate myself to reaching the 365 day streak. I have numerous screen shots but no way to fix the issue!!', ""I've been using Duolingo for about 3 YEARS! now, and really am enjoying the app. The pace of learning is totally up to you, and you can test out of easier levels if you already have some language familiarity. I appreciate the reminders, the variety of speaking reading and translating back and forth. There are challenges, practices, review of past mistakes, lessons, and even stories!!! Try it!"", ""While this has the potential to be a fun way to work on vocabulary for learning a language, the support for the app is nonexistent. The amounts of ads in the free version as well as being locked out for making mistakes makes it almost unusable, so I tried the premium version for my whole family. There were a lot of bugs and issues with getting access to features like following friends or in game power ups. The only thing you can do is to file a bug report, but I didn't get a reply or any help."", ""Duolingo makes it easy to learn the basics of a new language. Sometimes the app doesn't work properly, so I have to reinstall every once in a while. And I am not fond of running out of hearts especially over very simple mistakes. But I suppose the creators have their reasons. Maybe make the hearts take a shorter time to regenerate? A decent app for casual learning."", 'Duolingo is fantastic. I am truly enjoying this platform. It makes it extremely convenient and fun to learn a language in this manner. I took Spanish immersion classes my first year of college and spoke it off & on through the years. It has really started to come back. The format the exercises are in make it fun & relatively easy to work through. Cheers!!', ""I'm on the 2 week trial to see if I want to buy it for the family. It's actually really good and motivating but once you get to level three you start having memorizing which nouns are masculine, feminine, and neuter. If you had the option to create flashcards (in this app) from each lesson on the words that you're struggling with; this would be a five-star app, no question."", 'Good for Hindi, but needs more context. I have spent the last month working on the Hindi lessons. So far it has been great for learning the alphabet. My only problem is as I get into later lessons Duolingo fails to provide context around certain words. For example there are 3 different words for ""you"". I have a friend who is a native speaker who explained when to use each one, but the app doesn\'t explain that the different ""you"" words are based on how formally you want to address someone.', ""The app is really fun, there are many languages to choose from, and the combination of typing, speaking and listening in each lesson is more effective than how I learned in grade school. I'm not a big fan of the heart system, it will stop your lesson in its tracks. The competitiveness from the gamification can get in the way of playing to learn - you try to get experience points quickly with easy lessons instead of doing a longer, challenging lesson. $12/mo is too pricey - I'd pay $5/mo."", ""The app itself works as intended. Perhaps it works for some, not for me. It's far too discouraging. To advance, you are obviously competing with bots & people who are plus members. I get it; they want you to pay, but all the advertising pop ups ARE paying... If you work hard to move up, but for some reason can't spend the time, you get demoted and have to work your way back up. How is this encouragement? difficult to figure out sentence structure with no explanations. Too many negatives to list"", ""Duolingo is amazing if you want to learn a new language. With an ample choice of languages, you can pretty much learn any language you want. There is competition to keep you motivated which is great and if your friends join Duolingo, you can compete with them as well. The only problem I see in Duolingo is sometimes when you have to say the words of the language and you don't respond too fast, the audio will just mark you wrong. This may be a problem because of background noise or the system."", ""I had trouble learning Spanish since high school. Duolingo has helped me so much. The lessons are broken down into short and engaging sections you can complete in under 10 minutes each. The characters are relatable and their notifications aren't intrusive. I don't usually spend money on apps, but I went ahead and bought the paid version for a year and it's worth it for the extras. I had the free version but I wanted the unlimited lives, extra lessons, and stories to open without spending coins."", ""I use to really love Duo, it was easy and accommodating so could go at my own pace. Unfortunately it's changed to a weird heart system where after so many chances; you have to WAIT to be able to practice again. This is a huge blow to someone who has disabilities memory and learning. I don't learn this way. If it's a tactic to try and get subscriptions I get it(kinda) but you're really hurting those who Want to learn and don't have the money for that sort of thing. Very disappointed"", ""The app does a good job balancing ads with content and has been efficient at creating a habit of learning with content that, according to my non English friends, teaches the language in a way that can be used with native speakers. Cons: The heart system can sometimes be annoying, but the ability to fill hearts with practice at least makes it bearable. Also, some concepts that are fundamental aren't explained early on and I do find myself looking at secondary references often."", ""I like this app. It does teach well, but I think it would be better if duo got rid of hearts. It's annoying having to wait another day just for my refill of hearts and practicing the same lessons to achieve more hearts. Everyone should have the option to practice with unlimited hearts but that's my opinion. Also one more thing that's irritating is the leagues. It's hard because your competing against a bot or duo plus people and it's hard trying to advance xp above them. Its very competitive."", 'Fun, and easy. Just sometimes extremely repetitive. I appreciate the idea this pounds the language into your head, but I feel like true immersion involves a broader use of the language than the same statements over and over and over. It would also be far more enjoyable and less drudgery, to log in and expect to learn something new instead of dreading saying the same 5 things repeatedly.', 'Update: Support is abysmal. I\'ve been paying for the family version but the share link has been broken for weeks. Can\'t get a human being to assist. Frustrated. Excellent app for learning additional languages. Fun, comprehensive, and enjoyable while assisting with learning through repetition without being excessively repetitive. Neat little side ""quests"" to keep it interesting. Great combination of written, oral, and word tapping. The 20 minute a day tier helps me learn and advance quickly.', 'The lessons are an appropriate length of time and have multiple tools to assist in learning. It takes awhile to get through the same content, but you really know the language when it is (finally) complete. I like the different characters and especially love the stories portion. Thank you for a great app and a great learning platform.', 'Perhaps I am not using it correctly, but I find a big discrepancy between the lessons (boringly repetitive with not much content) and the practice and check sections, which introduce vocabulary and sentence structure never presented before. How is one to learn these? Guessing? Edit after many months of use: the lessons get better with time and I feel I learned something. Some translations make no sense in English, and the voices are contrived and annoying.', ""I've learned so much in just a week of having duolingo! I love how it is free and helps you when you make mistakes. Only down side is the lack of explaination. They give you random words expecting you to know them and they also leave out some spots of grammar. It can be confusing at times. However, it is paced out perfectly for me and I think it is super engaging. Tysm Duolingo!"", 'Very frustrating lately. The ""x"" to close ads have been tucked in places that are unclickable. When I go back with the android OS, sometimes I\'m not even sure if it\'s giving me the said reward of gems. To top it all off, the mute button has mysteriously disappeared. Wish I could post a screenshot of the ad layout, but I\'m not sure how.', ""This app is great for learning a new language in my opinion. I have made it to checkpoint 6/10 in the French course. It has a fun and game-like style that I just love. It can be a bit repetitive in the beginning, but if you get past that, it gets better. I would recommend using the website version as it doesn't have the hearts system when you make mistakes and it has less ads too."", ""I'm definitely learning, just not quite as I hoped. I can put the app down for months and come back and fall right back into step with ease, but there are still things to improve upon. Learning Mandarin, I can recognize characters and sounds and read what's in front of me, but I cant turn around and write anything on real paper unless its phonetic. It's not that great at teaching you to use the language in written form anywhere outside the app."", ""Good as an introduction to a language. Nothing more. Boasts how it has such a variety of languages but only provides limited lessons on some languages. But, If you like the conventional languages you're in luck. Annoying as it automatically enters you into silly competitions. And charges some people more for subscription depending on what country you're from. So, it's racist as well. So ok as a game, nothing more. Wouldn't recommend upgrading to duo plus, though."", ""This is a wonderful language learning applications, one of the best available ( : i rate it four stars, rather than five, because the audio recordings (for romanian, at least) are not always clear enough to distinguish the subtle differences in certain words, which can be a little frustrating at times, but it's amazing nonetheless considering this app is free!"", ""I have found that having an option to slow the speaker's rate of speech very necessary. The pace of the lessons seem very managable. I would prefer not to need hearts to continue lessons, but do value practicing before advancing to the next subject. I would love to have the option to learn with the speaker I can choose rather than random altering between male and female voices.""]",False,"['com.pinterest', 'com.memrise.android.memrisecompanion', 'wp.wattpad', 'com.digidust.elokence.akinator.freemium', 'com.netflix.mediaclient']",com.duolingo,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duolingo&hl=en&gl=us,

Please solve all the bugs in the videos and background"", ""What just happened!, I was trying to contact byjus via email but this out to work. The app was beautiful and perfect! The updates you guys did are an improvement but I don't understand why the app interface changed.

I like byjusexamprep and it is one of the best App.', ""This is the best learning app I've ever seen. The videos are very beautiful and filled with tonnes of animations, which make learning very simple and enjoyable. I adore the way the teachers at Byju's instruct. This app has been extremely beneficial to my exams as well as conceptual clarity. The SST section that has been added is just amazing... I'd appreciate it if the app included English language and literature as well. However, byju's app remains the best because quality outweighs quantity."", ""The topics on byjus are crisp n clear, fun, and intresting. The reason behind why I've given 2 stars is that, it always asks for the OTP whenever I open the application. It is also annoying when the byjus team calls us to enroll in the classes. When you go on with a particular topic for a few days or so, suddenly it says going at a great pace, denying us to open the topic. After all I had a Average experience with byjus."", ""I Gave this app a 3 star rating last month. I don't know if that issue is solved or not BUT the New version released just now is worse.

Hope you fix this ASAP."", ""In IAS subscriptions Early subscribers are dealt by the mentorship nicely but when it has been some time they stop paying attention to your problems and complaints. Its been a whole month I've raised my query. Mails, calls, everything in vain. Everytime I have to repeat my issue and it is very frustrating. They just assure you of transferring calls to seniors and resolving issues but they don't do it.

Feels clunky and unstable at times. Aspects to the glitchy video player that could be more intuitively designed. The title of the current section and video should be front and center as you are watching. It's frustrating having to scroll down through the entire list of sections for that course to find the title of the current video playing. Needs a better user interface"", ""I have many courses on my account (that I've paid for) and I have been using udemy for years. Suddenly in the middle of watching a lecture, the app decided the it won't cast anymore. I've tried to cast to 3 different chromecast devices (that were manufacured by google) and had the same issue, rebooted the phone, cleared memory, and re-installed the app, still the same issue remains. Many people on forums complaining about this, and I've contacted Udemy support - they are doing nothing"", ""I've been a user for several years. I love the service: courses are many and inexpensive. The app, however, is a piece of trash not fit to install. It is unresponsive, slow, unwilling to play videos I have downloaded to my phone, and unwilling to save files to the SD card, despite the fact the app allegedly has that ability. I don't know what the people at Udemy are doing but it surely isn't fixing this dumpster fire. They should take a few of their programming courses and fix the app."", ""I sincerely enjoy Udemy because of the great courses, but after having it for a few years I don't understand why there isn't a dedicated TV app. Chromecast is unstable with Udemy specifically. I can hardly get it to work. It often skips or returns to previous videos. Part of the enjoyment is watching courses on a big screen like you're in a classroom. If they actually manage to change these issues, I will proudly rate the app 5 stars."", 'Feb. 24 - after the update, can no longer access all of my courses through the app. When I click ""load more"" in my learning, nothing happens even though I\'ve purchased upwards of 50 courses. Only about 10 or so are accessible. 30/12 update - can no longer download course resources within the app 19/12 QA are easy to navigate. Course videos are good quality, ability to take notes and download lectures, as well as adjust playback speed.', ""Beyond frustrated with this app, I don't think anyone working on it actually uses it. All of the ways I try to watch, like on a plane via offline downloads or in my living room via Chromecast while eating, either barely work or not at all. Laughably, on a plane, I have to disconnect from the onboard network to get it to play files *locally* on my device. Streaming to Chromecast either doesn't work at all, or it breaks in frustrating ways like playing the same video over and over. I give up."", ""Casting is extremely busted, was hoping to use it for learning while running on treadmill but have tried multiple times. It keeps jumping to a previous video, no way to even skip ahead when it's casting to even work around it going to a previous lesson. Auto advance doesn't work either in casting. I have a unifi network with the access point near, new 4k Chromecast and pixel 6 so it isn't my equipment as I can cast multi other apps with zero issues. Can't get around with screen mirror either."", 'What did this app do? I see it shows my user info, but otherwise it just has a little ""loading"" spinner in the better of the screen. No indication of what it\'s doing, when it will finish, etc. None of my courses are listed. Useless Update: I guess all you have to do is give it a bad review and it will decide to work now. Not giving it any more stars though.', ""The Udemy app continuously stops on its own or crashes on both android & ios. I have tried using it on chrome browser, 3 different Android phones, an Android tablet, and 1 iphone and it's the same on all the devices except on the browser it keeps stopping on its own but doesn't crash. The app is even worse when trying to play the videos on a TV. When casting it from the browser it keeps stopping. I've been trying to use the app for years and I keep giving up because it's so bad."", ""The app simply does not work with Chromecast anymore, at least with Android. Just displays an error message when trying to cast. The app has been re-installed a few times and the Chromecast was rebooted, every other app I have works fine but this app will not. It's a shame as casting to a TV is a great way to study"", ""App plays videos out of order and frequently says there are issues with casting to Chromecast devices. Ran into these issues on two separate Android devices as well as two separate Chromecast devices (Vizio smartcast and Google TV device). Had to switch to use their website since the mobile app is having trouble. Guessing there is no QA or that they aren't being thorough in their testing."", ""Awesome app over all. Has a few bugs that could be worked out of it. My only real problem I've had was when I have a few courses downloaded the app would crash in low service areas. If you only download 1 course at a time you should be good though. Fix that and the app would be perfect."", 'Can\'t download your course? You can fix the ""trying to download, crashes app"" in v7.20.1 (this is current info as of 1/31/22) by downloading each course lesson individually. Yes, it\'s a pain to do. But at least you can have the courses offline. The 3* is reflective of the fact to remedy this issue I had to comb through the support comments. The app, content, and overall user experience (minus this incredibly annoying bug) has been great, otherwise.', ""Great content, garbage app. Constant connection and sign-in problems! Can log in on phone, but not tablet (credentials are saved to password manager on both devices, wont work with/without vpn). Can't log in with a VPN on any device, 2 different VPNs tried. Udemy, I love your content, but this app is trash. I've contacted support, no response or they can't fix it. Pluralsight is looking better and better..."", ""I like how you can download lectures or whole courses easily to either the SD card or internal memory. Changing the play speed is a great feature - I use it all the time. As my number of courses increases, it's getting harder to manage them. There's simply no way to organize or group courses effectively. This is getting so frustrating, I'm having to drop a star. Also, the app has difficulty playing consistently when my screen turns off or I move between apps."", ""Udemy is an excellent service and company that I am very grateful for (5/5). However, the app itself is insanely buggy. It's trash. Simply getting to the list of lessons in the course requires me to go back to the home screen and select the course all over again, which just ends up bringing up the video that's already playing. Then my video player will get locked in full screen mode. I literally have to close the app and reopen JUST to select a different video in the SAME course. So stupid."", ""This app I a HUGE disappointment. It has very limited settings. Videos automatically when you click on a course and you can't turn it off. It gives you the option to use an SD card, tells you it saving to it, but when you check the SD card in settings, it's all saved to internal storage, and then refuses to save to the SD card once it has eaten up all your internal storage. They also don't have in-app assistance or issue reporting. The website they want you to use is primitive a pain to use."", ""I like the course, but the app is probably the worst thing I've ever used on a phone. Want to download videos or the whole course? no problem you can do that, but you certainly can not play those downloaded videos if you have little or no internet connection. try uninstalling, reinstalling, airplane mode, jump through hoops and stop being able to get texts, because these guys are terrified of piracy and can't come up with a secure way to deal with it. streaming sites pull if off, but not udemy"", 'Courses are ok. There are two thing I dont like though. Casting the video lectures to Chromecast always results in the very first video of the whole course being played. To know how long a particular section is going to take to finish, you have to manually add the time taken by all the videos in that section. Why not show the time each section takes in total? This has been a pain everytime I sit to plan my studies and come up with a timeline to finish the course.', 'Suggested improvements for the app 1. While playing on 2x speed, audio on videos produces weird noises. I tested this on the website as well. Only downloaded videos do not have this problem 2. When switching to full screen mode, video should be able to rotate to the orientation which the user has held his phone. Sometimes the video shows up upside down', ""Despite downloading the videos, it still uses the data when viewing it. I have to physically turn off my data service in order to use the downloaded video. Also, it always automatically plays a video after clicking on a course. It doesn't not give me the option to pause it immediately, only after the video loads and waste a few seconds of playtime. Lastly, the video continues playing in the background, despite closing the application and going to another app. I would hope the video pauses."", ""More concerned with anti-piracy measures than facilitating learning. Can't screenshot slides from videos (changes to a black screen), closes when you switch to a note taking app, plays the wrong video when you return, downloads break more often than not (4 of the last 36 attempts worked), and overall unresponsive. A video that I downloaded that worked yesterday no longer works today. It's a mess. But hey, at least I can't steal the content I'm paying for."", ""I do like Udemy but I don't use it as much as I would like to because I'm not always able to get an internet connection. Luckily, Udemy has added the ability to install courses so I don't have to bootleg the courses I paid for. Unfortunately, this feature only works with Android/iOS and it does not save to the SD card even though there is an option for it. So, I can't install my courses onto my Chromebook as it doesn't have a lot of internal memory."", 'It cannot cast to Chromecast. I\'ve attempted to cast to three devices from my Pixel 6 Pro with same result. The target device displays ""Waiting for the Lecture"" but it never comes. The app displays ""There was a problem with Chromecast. Please try again"". I can cast to the same devices from YouTube, etc., the problem is not with Chromecast. Update: The support agent said paid courses cannot be cast. Claimed casting support is a myth. What\'s the point of showing cast button?', ""That it takes *forever* to load and play lectures when I have poor connectivity is a huge pain. I pre-dowloaded the lectures so that poor connectivity wouldn't be a problem but the app takes ~60 seconds to load and then ~20 seconds for a cached video to start playing is pretty embarrassing. Otherwise, I'm enjoying the course I bought!"", ""Even after several updates, this app is still garbage. Poor app experience, videos jump ahead, casting is inconsistent, controls to play, skip ahead or back don't work sometimes while casting. Inconsistency with app remembering where you left off in a course. Overall it's extremely buggy as there are too many issues to list. Casting is completely broken. App needs to be thoroughly tested and bugs worked out before releasing to users."", ""Casting/mirroring option buggy. When I cast (option within app) what's on the screen to a device, it plays a random lesson, not what's on screen. When I use the screen mirroring option (option on my phone), it shows everything on my screen but the actual video playing. It's a just a black square but the correct lesson is playing and I can see everything else on the screen just fine. I'm using an adroid device."", ""Don't use if you plan to Chromecast. I'm watching a series of lectures and numbers 10 and 11 (so far) won't cast. The app shows #9 and then jumps to #12. When I contacted support, they said (quite rudely) that it's not avaiable for all lectures. This makes no sense. Why is the Cast icon even showing for lectures that supposedly won't work?"", ""I have used this app for a few years now and it still surprises me how many bugs there still are. The most common that I run across everytime I use it is one that will randomly start playing the next video (and it will sometimes check mark the original video you were watching for you, making it hard to tell what you've missed). Udemy itself is great, but they clearly need some new people on the app development team."", ""Developers need to look at issues that we address here. Video from the index jumps to different ones, and it didn't happen on the browser. Video is unable to cast to Google Chrome, app display error while GChrome displays waiting for the lecture. I cleared cached, uninstalled, reinstalled, and it is still happening. I need to cast the lecture to my TV because I want to watch the video while having hands-on experience. Please fix the issue. Thank you."", ""The course was $14.99, but when added it to the cart and went to check out the price was changed to $89.99. Also, all courses were about $15, I logged out and logged back in 5 mins later and all of the prices were increased by A LOT! At this point I'm not yet sure if this was a technical difficulty or company's tricky greed. 🤔"", ""Over all the courses are good and there is a fair amount of courses to pick from. Offline is non existent. If you dont have a net connection it will not play offline downloaded courses. The auto play when you open a course also SUCKS. I use two devices to view my courses. Sometimes the other device doesn't update right and it will AUTO play the wrong one. You also cant just jump into the course to view notes without it autoplaying.... which if your offline will crash the app."", ""Courses are great, videos play great. But after many years of usage with over 30 courses bought, download continue to be a mess, there is no clear way to restart download, sometimes stops for no reason, it doesn't show what's on the queue and if I want to upgrade my SD card, most likely I will be forced to download everything again, So a download dashboard will be highly appreciated. If you provide a download experience comparable with the courses I will give it 5 Stars."", ""The app doesn't play downloaded content correctly. It will still try to play with mobile data, even when the video is already downloaded. This leads to lagging and at times no functionality. Yes, I've reinstalled and updated the app, signing in and out multiple times. This is an issue with the way it was coded."", ""For being an education platform, this Udemy app should be top notch and easy to navigate. The latter is true. This app has great potential to go from mediocre to awesome if you would fix little annoying things. For example you could fix the issue of the 'load more' button not functioning on the mobile phone app. I use the Galaxy Note Plus and I don't see my other courses because the app won't load them all. Please fix."", ""Edit 2: This app is not usable even on my phone anymore. I can't watch any videos, downloaded or not. I am connected to the internet and YouTube works perfectly. I can't put up with this anymore. Time to start using Coursera again. Edit: I can't see half of my courses on my tablet. Original: Video loading is extremely slow, much worse than YouTube. It's possible to download content, so that's good. But the app is a bit clunky. 3/5 overall."", ""Overall, I'm a fan of this app. I love being able to watch courses on my phone or cast them to my TV and it has many of the features that I liked with the browser version. But it still needs some work. The autoplay is random at best. Sometimes it will play several in a row and then suddenly need me to click on the lesson to load it. Other times it doesn't autoplay at all. Worst is when it decides to start an episode several minutes in and I have to go in and fix it. A decent app but not perfect."", ""The actual service udemy provides is great. It's a good way to learn new skills from insightful people, for a very affordable price. That said, the app is garbage. Yes, the videos take forever to load and don't play well, just like other reviewers have commented. But what's worse is that the app is incredibly difficult to navigate, classes are difficult to search for, and there are multiple courses which I have purchased that just don't appear at all on the mobile version."", ""A very good platform to learn new things, I passed my Comptia exams with the Total Seminar courses. I highly recommend Udemy.  My issue is with the app itself and the ads that pop up. There's nothing more annoying than a pop-up ad in the middle of a lecture of a course I paid for.    This seems to only happen on the App, I would recommend that anyone using it just download the lessons and play them in Airplane mode or just access them through a browser."", 'So far, so awesome! Just started my first course. Life coaching, no real direction in mind to use this practically, just wanted to know more about the subject. Great layout and lots of information. I\'d say it pays to do side research on the instructors prior to purchase, as I did see some ""quacks"". Be smart and think about the content before just jumping into a course.']",False,"['org.coursera.android', 'com.linkedin.android.learning', 'org.domestika', 'org.edx.mobile', 'com.skillshare.Skillshare']",com.udemy.android,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.udemy.android&hl=en&gl=us,"['com.udemy.android.ufb', 'com.udemy.android.ufg']"

It does not allow for screen rotation, so video presentation is limited to whatever the width (not length) of your screen is. It has an option for audio only, so you can cut back cell data usage while you\'re just listening. While using cell data, it also unexpectedly pauses, skips, and decides that you\'re done with a lecture while there are still several minutes to go. I haven\'t noticed this with WiFi data, but also haven\'t given it a thorough testing. Probably the second-most annoying part is that the app wants to launch every time I unlock my phone. I have absolutely no idea why. TL;DR? Sure you\'re going to be able to get your Great Courses stuff. Aside from that, it needs a lot of work. I\'d say ""one star, would not recommend"" except that the primary function works.', 'I LOVE the great courses. However, their apps have been lagged and not well designed. One good example is that I have to click individual episodes and download them. The app designers could have provided an option to download an entire course with just one click. Also, it is hard to know if a download has started or not. Wondrium app is still buggy and laggy. Hope it soon falls into the hands of good developers and designers', ""The content is fantastic but there are some minor complaints. I wish there was a way to see subcategories of subjects. I also would like it if there was a feature that allowed me to view the introductions to various courses in quick succession, sort of like an educational version of TikTok. It'd be a cool way to explore different courses without having to manually search for everything."", 'The library of courses from The Great Courses is great to have, but this mobile app is lacking in two quality of life features and fixes that would make it great. The first one is playback continuing after turning off the phone or putting the phone on standby. Both audio and video playback stop after pressing the power button to turn the display off. Audio playback continues for a few minutes and then stops. Video playback stops immediately. The second is keeping captions on downloaded videos.', '06/25/2021: Video plays for only a few seconds, then stops- as if ""paused"". To resume playing I have to click the video and press the ""play"" icon. Then it plays a few seconds and pauses again. This infuriating behavior occurs for both live streaming and downloaded video playback. This doesn\'t happen on the iPad, only on Android on my Samsung Galaxy S9+. Update: 02/12/2022. No resolution. This apps completely sux on Android, and no help from Wondrium. Just lame responses.', 'If I could leave zero stars, I would. Since becoming Wondrium we can no longer stream through Roku to use our subscription or access our previously purchased great courses. We tried reloading, changing the password, etc. Nothing worked. We contacted customer service. They apologized for the inconvenience, confirmed that we had paid our subscription and it is paid for the next 3 months (quarterly billing plan) but offered no help in fixing the problem. Used to be a good service, now it is a scam. Nov 17th Update: Thank you for trying to help. Yes, we knew they were two different Roku channels. When you go to the Great Courses the channel tells you to go to the Great Courses Plus channel. Then when you try to load Great Courses Plus, Roku says there is no such channel. The Great Course Plus channel is what we had that worked fine, until it switched to Wondrium.', ""Basically gives you free college courses on your own time from home! If you call Wondrium (before signing up) they'll give you a code to pay 1/2 price forever! Works on my Roku, firestick, & Android. When I use on my Android, app gives you choice of video or audio only. Listening with audio allows my screen to go dark while still playing. New courses always being added, a favorite list, & great search option. A+"", ""I like this service. There doesn't seem to be another like it. While other learning apps focus on career advancement, this app is for people who just like to learn new things. I was one of those weird people who enjoyed being in class more than partying while at college, and this service captures what is like to be in class. I really enjoy being engrossed in lectures by professors who are knowledgeable and passionate about what they teach."", ""Why is the quality so bad? Video quality seems to cap at 720p, which honestly is fine for me, but the audio sounds so bad most of the time. There is no question that there is a great wealth of information here, if you can grit through it. It's like Audible quality, tuned smartly for voice to sound okay at low bandwidth, but distractingly bad when you notice it. It also keeps telling me I'm not on wifi and interrupting my viewing when I def am on my home wifi. The constant popups say otherwise."", ""Content: 5 stars. App performance: 0 stars. Trying to cast from my phone to my Vizio TV with Chromecast/Google Assistant built in fails. On courses with the audio option it plays the audio, but on video-only courses it refuses to play. On my TV. 😒 I'm paying for this subscription specifically to use in our homeschool, so only watching it on my phone is NOT a viable option."", 'I was a heavy user of the previous version of this app and it was great! I love The Great Courses Plus and the app was simple but effective. Now the new version, I\'ll admit, is certainly more aesthetically appealing. Being able to collapse different course titles in the ""Downloads"" view is helpful, and I like having quick access to the PDF course guides. However, this version also took a few steps backwards: 1) Why can\'t we store videos on SD card anymore? Will TGC bring that back or has it been permanently removed? The videos take up a LOT of space and I was running low as it was. 2) Now all videos play with the status bar and button bar permanently visible instead of in full-screen view. Could you please at least provide a setting so users can choose whether they want full-screen or non-full-screen playback? 3) Whenever I\'m downloading a video for offline playback all the images on the screen start flashing. Not a problem but annoying and looks unprofessional.', ""2020-04-16 (revised to 3 stars) The folks at Great Courses Plus are obviously working on improving the user experience and have made a significant progress over the past 2 weeks. The latest version of the app (version 5.2) times out less frequently and hasn't crashed on me yet. Therefore, the original 1 star review is no longer warranted. There is still room for improvement, but kudos to TGC for the progress so far. 2020-04-04 (original review) The 1-star review is for the new release of the Android app and the lack of support for it. First general problems: The app hangs, crashes, and will go into spinner mode until you exit and restart it. This happens multiple times daily. And when it's not doing those things, it can be painfully slow. I suspect much of the slowness is due to a new back-end system implemented by the Great Courses. Things have gotten substantially worse after the upgrade to the new system (when all of the device passwords were reset). Specific bugs: 1) Speaking of passwords, the Android app has a 20 character limit for the password, even though the website will allow you to configure a longer password. There's no warning about this website. I had to figure it out the hard way. 2) The app allows you to download content so you don't have to stream and incur data plan charges. But inexplicably (I think because they never tested this), when you start to play downloaded content while not connected to wi-fi, you get a pop-up warning you that you need to change settings to allow data streaming because you're not connected to wi-fi. But this is the whole point of downloading content. And if you try to exit popup, you have either changed the setting (which I don't want to do - I downloaded the content because I *don't* want to stream over my data plan) or you haven't changed it and playback stops. So I just leave the dialog open and then app eventually crashes once I'm back in wi-fi range. Great... I haven't received a response to any of my recent attempts to contact Customer Service. As a long-time customer of The Teaching Company / The Great Courses (since the time when courses were sent out on cassette tapes) this is disappointing. They used to have very good, responsive customer service. It's a shame because the app and customer service are so bad that I'm ready to cancel."", ""I love the Great Courses, and based upon the content, I was planning on extending past the 30 day trial. However, I'm not sure I will. On my Samsung phone, it pauses every couple of minutes and gets really annoying to keep pressing play. This could be very dangerous for those that try to listen and drive. Also, on my phone, I have to exit the app a couple times in order for my content to appear. The roku app won't keep you signed in so it takes a while to sign in and it's really annoying."", ""The content is great. The app is a little slow and buggy sometimes but that's not a huge deal. The problem I had was strange and was never resolved. I did the free trial with intensions to renew and pay full price the next month. The next month rolled around and I was charged for the subscription, but my account was deactivated. I emailed the team to try getting this figured out and they still haven't fixed this. They refunded me, and they told me they'd fix it but it's been almost a month."", 'The app loses all my information llike Favorites or Downloads when it remains dormant for a period of time. I have to kill the app and restart it and it then remembers everything. In the past I had trouble accessing downloaded courses when I did not have an internet connection. It wants to reverify that you are an active member. I have not tested the latest version. Other than that, the app is great!. Finding, accessing and streaming a huge range of courses.', 'I love the material offered by The Great Courses, but the app has some issues. 1. Several days ago, I downloaded some lectures to listen while on a trip with limited internet access. Upon opening the app, I was greeted with the message ""We have made some changes that require you to upgrade to our latest version"" with no option to continue until the app was upgraded. Very annoying, and kind of defeats the whole purpose of downloading lectures. 2. During playback of lectures, the player will randomly pause, requiring me to manually restart. 3. No Android Auto support for audio lectures.', ""It's nice being able to take the courses with you on the go. The audio-only option allows me to listen in the car during my commutes. My only issue is I wish the size of the closed captions was adjustable. It is so teeny tiny on my S9 that it's pointless to try to use them. I don't really use this app as much as I would like because of this. I have a slight auditory processing issue and watching things with captions is very helpful for me."", ""Update: I added a star. The app is no longer struggling to load and play audio and video. Previous: The app itself is nice. But it really seems to struggle with audio and network interruptions - phone and sms. I've had to go as far as force stopping and purging local content to get it running normally again. It's unfortunate because it makes the product hard to enjoy."", ""Love the great courses but the app is terrible! Every single time I try to go back to where I left off it locks up, just loading forever. Occasionally I can do a search but cannot use the back button so no way to navigate to the menu, I just have to restart the app and loading in general is very slow so I'm never quite certain if I need to wait it out or restart. Once I actually get to the lectures playing audios/videos seems to work well."", 'The service is awesome but this app is an exercise in frustration. I will start a lecture and listen as I clean the house but invariably playback will stop and I have to pull out my phone, pause, then play again. It also never goes on to the next lecture without me having to do the same. It often stops playing new lectures altogether after two or three. Then I have to actually kill the app and restart it. This happens when downloading the lectures, too. It is pretty to look at, but I wish they had put more effort into smooth, reliable operation.', ""Best new feature: you can now download lectures in audio and listen offline. (Before, you could only download video lectures.) The app now marks your place in each lecture, even if you skip between lectures or courses. It now freezes much less often. If it gets wonky or slow, try restarting your phone. If you need to pause for more than a few minutes, quit the app and restart it when you're back. If you press play after pausing too long, it drops you at a random point in an earlier lecture."", ""Excellent value for the money. I listen to lectures in audio format when I'm driving for work and watch the videos when I have time at home. Seamless transitions between the two make it possible to keep up no matter what you're doing. I've learned so much thanks to these guys from Great Courses and Wondrium is just a step up in content. The only downside is poor app integration across devices. Don't count on seeing this on flex boxes, game consoles, or some other streaming devices."", ""Great content. Horrible app. Audio courses will play for 20 seconds and then stop so you have to keep pressing play every 20 seconds to get through the lecture. I thought the newest update would fix this, but it actually made it worse. Too many times I've opened the app to listen to a course and it simply wouldn't load. For a few days the app said I wasn't a member and didn't have access to the content. Really disappointing. I paid for a 3 month subscription and can't access anything."", ""There's so much content, and such a wide variety of lectures and courses to choose from along with guidebooks. Another awesome feature that's extremely useful for me is the ability to quickly switch from video format to audio format whenever I have to go somewhere or do something. My only recommended improvement would be to add something like a monthly credit to buy a singular lecture or course, and own it forever. Similar to Audible. All in all, great app. Recommend it a lot. 👍"", 'I love the Great Courses and was excited to subscribe to the Great Courses Plus. The content is excellent and the app is nicely designed. Unfortunately, I am unable to actually watch any video using the App. I have an app that runs in the background and updates information on my pull down menu every 5 minutes. Every time it updates, this App pauses the video or audio that is currently playing. Please try to fix this. If the app would automatically resume playing, it would be better. Thanks', 'The updated app includes the ability to download audio versions of each lecture, plus the associated guidebook. These are terrific improvements over the former version. Moreover, the functionality and user interface are great. However, I would still like to see the capability to download all lectures in a course with one button instead of clicking on all individually.', ""I really do not like this app. When it works it works well. When it screws up it does a great job! If your multi-tasking with this app you can forget about it. I paused my lecture, used GPS for around 15mins then went back to lecture and my lecture was gone. I had to restart and it doesn't restart from the beginning but it also doesn't restart from where it was initially paused either. That problem is bothersome but the app will aslo go as far as freezing up and will become unresponsive."", ""I like all the content the app has, however it's a little buggy. If I'm locking my screen , I can pause the app from the lock screen. However, if I click play from the lock screen, Not only does the course I want to listen to play, but also some random course I was listening too previously also starts playing. It's a little frustrating to have to open the app each time I want to resume my course"", ""I love the courses (selection and content), but the platform is terrible. I stream the courses at home and in my car. If I don't remember to open the app before leaving home, it does not recognize my ID and password when I try to use it in the car. When away from home,, I can't close the app because I have the same problem. Some of the older courses don't have an audio only option which uses more data if you stream them in your car. All the courses should have an audio only option."", ""The app used to be pretty bad and had a difficult to use UI. Also couldn't delete individual downloaded lectures, you had to delete a whole course of downloaded lectures. All these issues are now gone and the app runs much more smoothly now after an update that came out a late last year. Only thing I can think of that needs to change is making all lectures available for audio download, as I think there are still some that are available for video download only."", ""The content is wonderful. The app is not. It rarely remembers where I am in a lecture series, both within a given lecture and where I left off between them. It says that you can save the lectures to your SD card, but you can't. Also, the opening screen should be my watchlist, not some random collections of lectures in which I have no interest."", ""Edit: reduced to 1 star. After more than 2 years and hundreds of hours of lectures, I'm removing the app and canceling my subscription. Audio streaming has been failing to load with increasing frequency over the last year, and has now become entirely non-functional. Same issue on iphone X and Samsung S20+. Verizon, tmobile, wifi, all the same. I have one course to finish in video mode and I'll be canceling my subscription, and it's a real shame."", 'As the others said, the content is great. The lecturers are good, and the topics are many and interesting. The applications (be that on Win 10, Fire or Android) leave a lot to be desired. There is no consistency across the board (which happens when someone hires different contractors to build them without having an overall standard), and unfortunately the android app is just useless in my case because I cannot listen to the lectures, only watch them. Cancelled my subscription after an year.', ""Great content let down by a bad app: * You can download content, but you must be online to access (why bother?). * You cannot download audio only for many lectures, leading to needlessly big downloads/data. * When you download the video and let your screen sleep, the audio stops. * There's no easy way to see where you left off. * Way too much focus on video for what is great audio content. * No Android TV support at all. All in all, there's a lot that feels poorly thought out and woefully executed. The inability to play content offline is absurd. All the major streaming services have that figured out, but here it's a mess. I still kinda recommend the overall product, but the app makes it absolutely painful. It's a mess."", 'Good content. Greatest problem is that you cannot download the audio of a video course. Thus you have to stream it if you are away from wifi; not good if you have a limited data plan. Downloading the video and playing it later would work but for my battery being more quickly depleted by playing the video just to listen, not watch. May quit when my free trial is up.', ""This app has been amazing, there are so many learning opportunities. I've been listening mainly to history lectures as I work from home but there is so much more I'd love to dive deeper into when I have time. There was recently an issue where my subscription was canceled without my input but they helped me sort that out. Something to do with Google play, not the apps fault. Point being, they have always been very helpful to me when I need it."", ""TL;DR Wonderful learning tool if the audio playback worked consistently. App content has been great so far, but it's good I'm on a free trial because the audio playback is buggy. I drive truck so I want to be able to listen to audio in the background, but I often can't get it to start playing... The loading spinner spins and spins, but no audio. If I choose video, it normally starts in ten seconds or so, but then it stops playing when I send the app to background. It's an irritating Catch 22."", 'If you installed the upgrade that was pushed out on 2/12/2020 and are stalled at the sign in screen (just a spinning circle and the words, ""Signing In""), try going first to the ""Browse Courses"" option at the bottom of the screen and then use the sign in button that is available there. That was the only way I could get past the stalled ""Signing In"" screen that came up whenever I tried to sign in directly from the starting screen. Love The Great Courses Plus. Still room for improvements to the mobile app, but they\'re working on it.', ""The content is genuinely top-notch (I'm often quite surprised by the production quality) and had a wide variety of topics to choose from. The app is a little slow and sometimes buggy, but I expect it'll improve in time. Pricing is kind of expensive, but they're making new courses regularly so it doesn't seem like such a waste to me. I'm overall very happy with Wondrium."", ""Fantastic but dated. Catalogue is huge and the speakers well selected. My only complaint, and unfortunately it's a big one, is how dated all these lectures are. The ones I've listened to are all from the 2000's. Much has changed and been discovered since than. I'm left to wonder how come these arent being rerecorded every few years. Even once a decade would be in improvement.""]",False,"['com.emeritus.mobile', 'com.alison.mobile.flutter', 'com.skillshare.Skillshare', 'fm.alpe.app', 'org.edx.mobile']",com.tgc.greatcoursesplus,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tgc.greatcoursesplus&hl=en&gl=us,['com.teachco.TGCviewer']

ABC Kids is a free phonics and alphabet teaching app that makes learning fun for children, from toddlers all the way to preschoolers and kindergartners. It features a series of tracing games to help kids recognize letter shapes, associate them with phonic sounds, and put their alphabet knowledge to use in fun matching exercises. Any toddler, kindergartener or preschool age child can learn English and the English alphabet simply by following the arrows with their finger. They can even collect stickers and toys as they complete tracing games!

ABC Kids is more than just a kid-friendly educational app, it was designed with adult participation in mind, too. The interface keeps toddlers focused on alphabet reading and writing, tucking menu commands away from moving fingers. Adults can easily access settings to engage Teacher Mode, look at report cards, or toggle tracing and phonics games to better facilitate learning.

Best of all, ABC Kids is full-featured and free from in-app purchases and third party advertisements. Toddlers and adults can enjoy learning together without interruption.

Features:
- A colorful early education app that helps children learn the English alphabet.
- Includes ABC tracing games, phonics pairing, letter matching, and more.
- Uppercase and lowercase letters to trace, listen to, and match.
- Smart interface helps kids focus on phonics and letters without accidentally exiting the game.

Note to Parents:
When creating ABC Kids, we wanted to build the best experience possible for both adults and for children. We're parents ourselves, and we know how paywalls, in-app purchases, and intrusive third party advertisements can detract from the learning experience. With ABC Kids, we put the features of a paid app into a preschool friendly package, leaving out frustrating pop-ups and microtransactions. The end result is exactly the educational experience we want for our children. We think you and your family will enjoy it!

It would play and then immediately pause. The audio only trigger in the video triggers a loading icon over the video. But doesn't actually do anything else from what I can tell. Quite often when watching videos the sound doesn't seem to line up with the people's mouth movements."", ""Autoplay consistently autoplays maybe 10% of the time. The other 90% of the time, when it gets to the end of the recording and should theoretically then start to play the next in the series, it just stops and I need to manually click the play button. There's no rhyme or reason. It could be streaming off wifi or cellular or it could be something downloaded for offline listening. It's infuriating when I'm doing something and my phone isn't nearby or easily accessible (like if I'm prepping food and my hands are covered in food). Also even though my work LinkedIn account is linked to my personal LinkedIn account (via the two different email addresses), if I complete a course with my work LinkedIn Learning account (which I get for free), I can't add a certificate of completion to my personal LinkedIn account, even though they're both linked together."", 'I mostly enjoy using the app, but there is a glaring issue. The user experience needs better functionality by creating a ""begin"" or ""start"" button for courses. There have been many times when I have merely tapped on the picture of a course to view more information, but the tap sets the course to begin. Now the course has begun, is a part of my history, and I get suggestions for more courses like it. A simple button to press when users are actually prepared to begin a course would alleviate this', 'I like that it maintains track of your progress, but it\'s hard to navigate in a video or see quickly where you are if you are looking at the contents screen. I wish there were a ""back 30 seconds"" button so I can have something repeated. I wish it integrated better with Android Auto so that I can listen like it\'s podcasts better. I used the AA today, but it didn\'t see the downloaded lessons. I love the offline feature. I love the whole concept. The lectures and tutorials and speakers are amazing.', 'I recently subscribed to LinkedIn Learning/Lynda and I am very much impressed overall with the service, both on the web version and the mobile versions of the apps. I have been able to find courses on everything I am looking for and there are usually a few instructors for each topic. One might think this is a terrible thing because of potentially repetitive information, but by simply watching the different instructors, you may find someone who makes you feel most comfortable which is most important in any learning experience. This is a fantastic service to support experts who are willing to take the time out to teach and enrich those who are willing to learn. Thank you for the service!', 'Good, not great. It desperately needs a ""Dark Mode"" option. I really like that there is an option to turn the video off and only listen to the audio, however there\'s an odd glitch that keeps courses from automatically continuing when the screen is off (in my pocket), I have to unlock the phone and go to the app and it will begin playing again. Other than that, this app is great.', ""They've included a larger number of courses that were on other learning platforms and rebranded them. The problem is so many are outdated or low quality. My biggest issue is the price isn't justified for the amount of high quality original content. I think you're way better off saving your money and looking for sales on individual courses in other platforms or wait until you have time to binge watch a bunch of courses and issue for just one month."", ""Has all of the features needed. I love downloading the courses to the phone so that I can learn while away from a decent signal. It's also very easy to remove the video from the phone to clear up storage. A higher resolution video option would be great. sometime seeing instructor's screens in 720p resolution isn't always the best."", 'Great application! Well worth the monthly fee! What you learn can improve your skills in many different areas in job related skills... and some in personal success and achievements too! What I learned in one course paid for the entire year service! All I do is, I use it to broadcast to my TV through Google Chrome. What I would like, however, if it would be back available on the Roku app as well as there is only a limited version available now, not the full version. Thank you...', ""The videos are good and educational. The issue I have is that after a few lessons completed, I was no longer able to add a new skill or lesson to my profile. I reached out to tech support and appeared to receive a response from a bot. I was instructed to uninstall and reinstall the app to fix the problem and it didn't resolve the issue. When responding again about the unsatisfactory results, they closed the ticket."", ""Problem if you want to run this app on a tablet and split the screen to simultaneously watch videos and write with your note taking app. Video will stop playing (audio continues) when writing notes in split screen. A quick workaround is to use a browser app like Chrome instead of this app to play the course videos. However, I am prompted to open the LinkedIn Learning app again for end of chapter quizzes. If the video playback issue in split screen gets fixed, I'd happily give this 5 stars."", ""The learning and videos are good, but the app is a little problematic. The quizzes time-out sometimes, also selecting answers is annoying because it thinks you're selecting an answer when really you just want to see the next multiple choice option. Download to play later works better if you download when you have wifi and watch when you have shoddy internet. If you don't download and try to watch in bad internet... well, you won't. The buffering will take forever, the quality will dip, and you may have to re-watch the same section over and over. Basically, use wifi. If on the road, download beforehand. I also sometimes get the issue of watching a video and it not registering as being watched. Otherwise the content is very good."", 'If you are looking for beginner, intermediate or continuation training on almost anything you can think of, this is the app to use. Each lesson is broken down into small blocks with quizzes, it is easy to follow along. I have found so many management training courses here where I can continue improving my skills as a manager, leader, and mentor at any career I choose.', ""Hasn't worked for months. It stays either on the loading screen or the login screen. I first downloaded this in late 2019 and it worked great until an update came along. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling many times with no luck. I've waited patiently for a fix, but 4 or so months on and it's still broken. I've given up on it."", ""Highly intuitive, seamless e-learning app. I'm blown away by the options to cast to my devices from my phone if I want to watch the videos on large screen on my sofa. There is also offline downloading of the material, attachments with learning material and the option to easily add any course certifications to your LinkedIn profile. The courses are laser-focused and of high quality- not just thrown together for an extra buck. There are plenty of different classes and the instructors are engaging."", ""LinkedIn learning is great, almost. The worst thing about it is trying to login through your organization or school. It just doesn't work and you have to sign in through the desktop site for it to work. The great thing about it is the ability to download courses. Sadly it's only for mobile and watching videos on a phone while working on my laptop suck. There is hope install BlueStacks on a computer and you can work from a dual monitor setup and it is a dream come true. Please make a desktop app."", 'Does not work at all. I have an account online all set up. I have tried to log in several times on this app. I copy and paste the email and password so I know they\'re correct. The app goes to an error screen that only says ""Something broke. Looks like we\'ve taken the wrong exit here."" This happens if I log in with my LinkedIn or school account. The website is great. App is useless.', ""Roll back the update. It has an audio only function, so there's no need for background play. The link you provided below asking me to email you doesn't take me to an email form/client. Anyway, when turning the phone into landscape the video should become full screen. Do you know how difficult it is to land on that little full screen button?"", ""Buggy and missing features. The mobile webpage is much better. I'm working through multiple learning paths and need my notebook. Can't access notes or add new ones. That alone makes having the app pointless. I was hoping the app would make it easier to find my way into the learning paths but LPs, courses and video are mingled. Worse than the mobile site. Please go back to how Lynda had it. Tree format. LP/courses/videos. Let me drill down to the thing I'm looking for."", ""Don't want to give full 5 but better than 4. I like it has a lot of tech stuff I want and have added other important life lessons that can help anyone. What I think takes away a full 5 stars is they need to add an attribute to videos if the video can be only listened to as in it does not have nesscary visual information. This way you can search for them. I like to listen when doing other things but pointless when they are explaining how to do something and need to see it."", ""I'm sorry that some of you didn't get what you needed from your courses, but I had a really great experience with both courses I signed with. The instructors, Dennis Taylor and Annyce Davis, were awesome. I was annoyed in the beginning that I couldn't find the transcripts right away and that they weren't uploaded for a while, but they eventually appeared. But the app experience was fine for me. I had more of an issue using the course on desktop."", ""I finish my courses in a learning path, but when I go to print my certificate it looks like gibberish. It is not clear what the certificate is for. Waste of time if I have no certificate to show for. *Update: I was contacted by LinkedIn Support and was given instruction to fix this issue. I've so far been pleased with how quickly they respond with an accurate solution to a problem. I've adjusted my rating from 1 to 4 stars due to the great support."", 'mobile is missing many features from the browser version, including transcript of videos, that make it frustrating at times. Sometimes gets confused on what you have and havent watched. videos dont get very big on mobile even in fullscreen mode, any small text is impossible to read, any cursor impossible to follow. there is an audio only option which is great. navigation is fine, search is good. sometimes limited learning on topics.', ""Signs me out everyday, so I have to re login. Audio only toggle button does not work. Downloads don't display for a while once logged out, and you cannot choose the quality or type of download (audio only/+video). All the features are there that should make it work well, but none of them are refined enough to work the way they should."", ""App is ok but has flaws at times. It stopped tracking time towards my goals, then suddenly started working and then it stopped again. Sometimes it will just never load at the beginning. I've tried numerous installs again with no difference. I really love LinkedIn Learning and would like more consistency with the app."", ""Works well but there are two issues. I have to wait a long time to access my downloaded videos when I'm offline; it leaves options blank until the app stops trying to access the internet. I know many deam android tablets dead but as a tablet user I would appreciate it if I could set this app in landscape mode at the very least."", ""In terms of usability Lynda was much better, especially the search feature. At the minimum stop listing random tiny modules from various courses when one search for some stuff, this does not add any value, rather the search should list down links to the 'whole course' sorted based on to what extent the searched keyword item is covered in the respective course. Course duration should not be more than 2hrs, ideally 1 hr or lesser."", ""This is by far the best online learning experience I have ever encountered! The extra tools available are very user friendly. Tag stuff you want to view again or skip sections you already know. You can even join groups in the courses to work with others taking the course too. I set a goal to do 30 minutes a week and because it's a great format with useful information, I average 2 hours a week. There's courses in here for everyone, you gotta try it!"", ""Horrible app. Downloads and videos hang when signal strength intermittently changes and never recover. Courses don't start playing even when partially downloaded. Search tool terrible- results are not selected or organized by topic. Search just pulls whatever courses that contain keyword as part of course information, so pretty useless because you have to sort through many irrelevant results. No intuitive course preview from search. i have to use this app for work and hate it."", ""The video screen is small. I think it's meant just for mobile phones, not for Chromebooks or large screens. I can't find a way to maximize it to fill the screen like the Lynda app and all other video training apps. It's no different than the regular Linkedin app. You have a small video at the top and menus and places to post underneath."", ""way too much buffering. I don't have this problem with any other streaming app. Only LinkedIn learning app. The functionality is fantastic but every 30 seconds I have to wait 15 seconds for at the buffer. And there is no option available to change the quality of the stream."", ""This app is amazing. Can't get enogh of it. It works really well and has tons of educational, and professional courses to work throgh. However there is no transcript for mobil devices so I take notes accordingly. The collections design could be better since it sometimes does not show a collection you have made if you have more than 15 collections with more than 20 or 15 courrses in these collections. But overall amazing and brilliant work."", 'The phone app doesnt load anything, just gives the error; ""It\'s not you, its us."" I cant access any courses and there seems to be no fix. I\'ve tried uninstalling and other fixes I could find, but none have worked. Don\'t pay for premium if your main access to the learning center is through your phone. Doesn\'t make sense to pay for something you can\'t access.', 'I use this with a corporate subscription through my employer. i like linkedin learning, but this app needs improvement. i am taking a course (ruby part 1) and it has a video. \'no way to watch it on my phone in full screen with my 6 inch pixel! i cannot get the ""table of contents"" ""drawer thing"" below the video to autohide or just stop displaying. it covers a third of the screen and it obscures the bottom portion of the video. that is just obnoxious. fix and i will up my rating.', 'I love LinkedIn learning, but it needs help for tablet viewing. When using app on mobile cell phone, it auto adjusts to the screen size. When using on a Samsung tablet, and full screen landscape, the video is cut off on left and right side. The only way to see it in full, is to use tablet in vertical mode. Using the tablet vertically, makes the video only a little bigger than if I used my cell phone. Please correct so I can watch full screen horizontally on my Samsung S3 tablet. Thank u!', ""It's okay I guess.... It plays videos, but it doesn't allow you to download them in higher quality at least on my tablet which has the ability with other apps. Also, the most annoying problem is that after I change the storage location to SD card it always reverts back to internal storage."", ""No dark mode. When you scroll down video would dissappear.. Update. People from linkedin has responded which makes me give the app one more star. The attention to my issue seems matter for linkedin. That's good. The problem is simple, when I am watching a video in my android phone and I scroll down to check the topics I already have watched or the upcoming topics, the video window would dissappear after few scrolls down, it would not stay at the top.."", ""This is such an awesome database of useful content! The app is easy to navigate and find what I'm looking for. The only complaint I have is if I'm in audio-only mode, and my screen is locked, when a video finishes, it won't play the next one until I unlock my screen. it's odd and quite annoying, but not a huge deal."", '""Upgrading"" from Lynda to LinkedIn Learning was more of a downgrade, seeing how I can no longer download and view courses offline on my laptop, which is the preferred hardware to watch tutorials since I can actually follow along. Using my phone to watch tutorials only work with courses I\'m already familiar with, or that are entirely explanation based without follow along instructions, which aren\'t many. I\'ve used Lynda for years, so I\'m confident the courses are quality, bring back desktop app!', 'I mostly use as a supplement for book study. However, this app is gaining momentum as a trusted primary source for me. I hope to see the tracks a little more defined in the future though.

It's awesome. There are a plethora of great books. They miss many of my absolute favorites, but the ones they have are very good and we've found new favorites. And tons of audiobooks! Those are fantastic to have. However, finding all the books in a reading level is impossible, and I very much wish that was MUCH easier. I create lists myself and have found workarounds, but it's annoying and I wish we could search by reading level only."", 'Love epic but the app has flaws. Having to log in every time you open it is a pain. The pane that pops up to show book progress while you are reading cannot be closed manually. So if you are using the app for children who who often touch the screen while they learn to read this pane makes it very difficult. Searching options need to improve with better filters. It is sometimes difficult to find an age appropriate book in a timely manner for your students. I could go on but out of characters.', ""This app is great! I like the variety of books available, though I hope the library continues to expand. The user interface is easy to navigate and I love being able to download for offline reading. Two things I'd like to see added are a repeat button so the littlest readers can easily replay the same book again and again. Add the ability to download the book from the non grid style list along with the available options, collection and/or favorite."", 'The books offered to read and explore are absolutely wonderful! The app works great. Sometimes it may stall. It gives you a warning in the beginning stating the the device used may not support the picture. Using a cell phone, it is working good. Epic is definitely an enjoyable, educational app for all ages. Use it for long rides in the car as a passenger. It is a fun and productive way to pass time.', ""We like this app, however, there are issues with it. Sometimes when we save books for offline, they don't save. The app closes and freezes alot. This gets frustrating. We no longer live near a library, so this became a reading option for a family of avid readers. Unfortunately, the app doesn't always function well."", 'I would have given this a 5 star before the last update. But since then, you can no longer turn your phone screen off! You have to leave it on the entire time! In the old version you could turn the screen off & continue to listen. But now my son is concerned about screen burn. He used to listen to them ALL THE TIME! But since he can no longer turn off the screen, he hates using it. The book selection is great but for $8 a month I should still be able to turn off my screen. Considering canceling', ""I really like this app. BUT.... the only thing I dont like is that you cant use it after school hours unless you are paying for it. And when the child is reading and gets stuck on a word , you sometimes can click on the word and it will help the child by saying it and the noun if the word. But is not all words. For example the word nervous my daughter couldn't read it so she clicked on it and it was empty. No definition it dint help her with what it say and other easier words too. please fix."", ""They must be about to shut this app down. There is no other reason for the rapid decline of this service. When we first signed up ~ 1 year ago, it was good. All books were good & age-appropriate for my 4 yo. She liked the badges & seeing the progress bar really motivated her to keep reading. Now it's a real piece. Most of the time it gets stuck on the loading screen, she's capped out at level 23. Progress bar is grayed out & there are no more badges to earn. Thereare no quality books anymore."", ""Epic app never works! On tablet or phone it forces you to download the app. Once downloaded it is sooooooo slow that it crashes every time. If you try through the browser you can't go beyond the screen to download the app. If you try to log-in off school hours on your laptop, I get stuck having to choose from 2 paid plans. Epic free doesn't seem to be available anymore even though they said it's available. I am so disappointed with this company. Thanks for wasting our time."", ""I'm going to split my review into two parts: Epic's content: We originally got Epic through school. We have access to 6 different services for our kids to read. Of all of them Epic is the best so we decided to subscribe. It's easy to use and the kids are actually excited to read on Epic. The Android app: It works fine but is missing some key features. No way to download books or audio books for offline usage in the car. Also when playing an audiobook you can't use the phone for navigation."", 'Great app with one area of improvement, being the integration with Google Auto, ie. There is no integration. Would be good to have the audiobooks play and have control via the car console when using Google Auto. Right now it needs to be done from the phone and the sound in Google Auto shows the other app that is integrated. This is one location where I could really use Epic!', 'I Love this app! It\'s very fun for the kids have a list of their favorites and the ""read to me"" option is also good help, when I\'ve got to help another child with their school work. Kids also get to change their profile pictures as they earn higher achievements. The only issue we\'ve had... is that I can\'t seem to be able to link our already existing account, to his teachers group, with all of his classmates.', ""Ok. This app is both amazing and frustrating. The content is awesome! Entertains my 3,10 year olds. But! Wretched customer service! Contacted them with issues 2WEEKS ago and was given 2 automated messages!! Clearly they did not read email AT ALL! My complaints: the read offline button is missing. There is no bookmark function. You can't listen after turning device screen off. Glitchy. Won't track progress across devices. Sometimes loses place on the same device! Epic, your move."", ""Wonderful app. My daughter loves it. However, I upgraded to Unlimited through Google Play but the upgrade is not reflected in the app. She still can't access what she wants, and it still shows up as Epic Free. I submitted a support request days ago with a copy of the receipt and I haven't heard a word. No one gets back to you. My advice is to stay on the free side until they fix the upgrade issue and until they have the capacity to deal with their support tickets."", ""The best feature of this app by far is the appearance of the digital books, as compared with books on Amazon Freetime, which download slowly, and are hard to read until you double click the paragraphs, which is difficult to get right with a child, etc. Even the digital books on Libby are sometimes frustrating to read. Every book, audiobook, read-to-me books, and videos play seamlessly. The selection is excellent including books in Spanish! I also love that it's free to educators."", ""I LOVE this app. My daughter loves this app. The books are adorable, and there's even some of her favorites. However, I gave it 3 stars because there has been a handful of times we start listening to a Read To Me book and the narration stops completely or starts and stops. If that could be fixed I would absolutely give 5 stars AND purchase the unlimited membership!"", 'This app has been a game-changer in my Pre-K classrooms. Not only do students have options for books that can be read to them, they also have access to relevant educational songs and learning videos (which teachers can also disable if they so choose). I love the ability to create Collections and send them to students based on interests, or reading levels. Students as young as mine also benefit from the class code sign in process.', ""Ehh. Needs work. Offline mode is not available. Audio books do not show text. My kid is using in class and wanted it at home. Purchase didn't work on app had to use browser. Not worth 7.99 a month subscription. My background 8 years of android development experience. This app should have been done better. I am going to see if there are better options."", 'Fantastic for my son but the activity reporting is bugged. He loves the selection of books although I would love to see the inventory selection grow to include more classic classroom favorites like Robert Munsch. I like that we can see what he is into, and get reports on his activity. The UI design seems appropriate and pretty simple for a child to navigate. The one negative is that the number of books and the time spent reading are added incorrectly, reporting much higher than actual activity.', 'A lot of titles. Some have quizzes. I would recommend the app tag books with quizzes as well as make the reading levels filter more effectively. It does sometimes feel as if I am looking through 40k titles to find the right type of book for my child. Other than that this app is great. Definitely worth the monthly subscription, especially if you have multiple children.', 'Absolutely wonderful app for young readers! It has a wide selection of the best storybooks for children beginning with picture books and on. There are quite a few readers as well...honestly you must check it out to believe it. The illustrations in the books are beautiful and the readers for the Read with Me books and the audiobooks are absolutely excellent! Thanks for such a wonderful app for reading!', ""Love this app! A world of books for kids to read including old favorites and new books you would find on the shelves and in Scholastic. Read to me section is great and let's kids explore on their own even when you can't be there to read to them. I feel confident that when my kids watch the videos available that it is all kid friendly content.Truly wonderful and I reccomend it to all. *Please add a heart to each book on the menu so that we can press to add to favorites without opening the book."", ""Updated review- We were very happy with the app at first, but it has a lot of bugs. Customer service is friendly,and tried to help, but the problems still persist. The app uses your 2 hours of after school time even though it says you have switched over to school time and then doesn't work for the week. Now it's not recording what books we have already read. Great concept, but needs a bit of work."", ""My child and I enjoy this app a lot! Lots of things to do and lots of books! The only thing I don't like about it has to do with the books that read to you. When the page turns, the voice that's reading will say the first word of the next page, but then it'll cut out. Once the page is turned it repeats the word again. It's annoying because it breaks up the book flow. Can this be fixed? At first I thought I had something wrong on my side, but a few of my friends had mentioned the same thing."", ""Great app but doesn't work normally , whenever you finish a book it doesn't count, sometimes you'd be at 105 books read and wouldn't get the badge for it. For some characters and patterns you can't tell how to get it unless you're on computer and we're usually on ipad. Overall great app! Sometimes people get competitive about who's the highest level which is okay! A(nd not the apps fault.)"", ""I wish this app would work for us, I installed it for my kids 3 year old and 5 year old. Both are learning to read, and could not read on their own yet. The problem is, this app shows all sorts of books, and doesn't label the books according to their appropriate age category. I don't see any option for filtering the books according to age, level of difficulty, or level of reading proficiency. So finding an appropriate book to read for my preschooler is a hit and miss. Also, the read to me option is not interactive at all, its like watching a video, not a reading experience. I want my kids to be able to read along, ie they should be able to follow the reader verbatim, and then flip the page at their own pace. I guess this app is not so suitable for early readers (pre-K or grade K)."", ""Love it!! I am a mother and all 4 of my kids use it. It's awesome that some of 4he hooks are read to you and the words are highlighted. It helps so much with my little ones and it has other books that you can read on your own. My kids use it when we are in the car and they just go from book to book. The app is easy to use for any kid and it's just a great amount of book options for many age groups."", 'Incredible way for my kids to enjoy reading and learning on the go no matter what we are doing they can read or be read to. They enjoy searching through the videos to watch something new. And most importantly I know they are safe with what they are reading/watching. They now easily read more then an hour a day. Not including listening to or reading stories while driving, brushing teeth, or while we are out and about shopping. We love the human voices and the dialogue is fun to listen too.', ""Looks cool. BUT if you choose the free version there is a time ⏰ limit that I blew through just scanning books to see what they have! Decent selection but irritated that there was no warning ⚠️ and it was so short. Not sure if we will be using this app I don't think I have even been on 30 minutes and locked out of books. 🤔"", ""Wish they would warn you that you must pay a fee to get this app before you input all your personal information. BEWARE do NOT input your info unless you want to pay a monthly fee. I would had not mind paying for the membership but I don't like it when apps like this pull this kind of stuff to get your email to start sending you junk mail even though you decide not to go forward with the app. Now they sending unwanted junk mail. Ugh so annoying!!!"", ""This app is amazing. My daughter is finishing kindergarten and its perfect for helping her read. She can try on her own, the app can read it to her while magnifying the word that it's speaking or of course I can read it with her. Some books have quizzes at the end while everything gives you points towards a level and unlocking achievement badges. On a galaxy s10 or even the desktop website, it's very user friendly. After school ends I will definitely be signing up again."", 'My child is enjoying all of the books and features of this app. I also like that some of the books we have at home can also be found on epic. The only thing that I would like changed is to have a bigger font size of the text to some of the ""read to me"" books from my phone app - it\'s way too small for me to read (and I have a large screen) so my child can\'t follow the words when it reads to him and he can\'t try to read it himself to practice.', 'Update: App opens to blank screen alot. We are also finding books that are inappropriate as well as not quality. There is a whole series advertised on here called Catbug which talks about poopy pants (2 seperate books) and shutting his ex-girlfriends antennae in the door. I like using Libby or Overdrive for online reading. When my library account was suspended for non renewal, I tried this app. The books are well formatted to ebook use and there is a great selection.', ""I like epic but some of the books don't have a play button on them. For the audio books my daughter and I like to read. So therefore we are unable to read them and that is very disappointing bc some books I really want to read and it happens alot please fix. Also it skips pages when reading books and won't let us go back and some times kicks us off completely and I have to log back in other than that I like it but I do ask that you can fix the glitches please."", ""This is the app that helped my daughter to learn how to read, she loves it! She reads everyday from the largest variety of books it has. We discover the app when she was in 2nd grade and we'll keep it for many years. It also has books in Spanish which is a plus!! Every time you connect it shows you books according to your reading level, and it allows you to save books to read later when you're offline. It also allow you to connect your account with epic school and track her performance."", ""This app is absolutely great for sharing the classics I used to read when I was growing up, and I can also find a vast amount of new, award winning, and age appropriate tittles for me to share with my 6 year old daughter. This app has been a life saver in the grocery store and on long car rides because of the ability to have a narrator read the books if I'm not able to at any moment. Very glad we have downloaded this app onto all of my family's devices! Well worth the subscription fee!"", ""I have been using Epic for over a year and greatly enjoyed using it with my granddaughter and some others that I tutor. I pay monthly. This month, I started seeing books that say they are only available with an Unlimited account. I attempted to Upgrade to this Unlimited version even though I was frustrated that they started this and never contacted their subscribers. I sent two emails through their Support system and have heard nothing from them. If it's technical difficulties, please say so."", 'My son loves this app! His teacher recommend during quarentine/homeschool. He loves to read now! My son is 5 and autistic. He learns better with Auditory learning then visual learning! Epic gives you that! But still includes visual learning! The app uses visual ques by highlighting the word when the person reading the story aloud on the select read to me books! It also features books on different reading levels, so the he continues to grow. There are audio books & awards to earn for reading too!', ""This app doesn't remember the place in audiobooks where you left off. I need to write down timestamp every time I switch off the phone & then manually find it, takes forever! Also you need to have all open with screen unlocked! App cannot play audiobook with screen off. And I am a paid subscriber! This app definitely needs serious improvement"", ""Good app. Could be made better by allowing audio books to be listened to with the screen off. Also It doesn't keep the last location listened to in the audio books. Otherwise its a very good app. Good selection and easy to use for my 4 yo and my 10 yo.""]",False,"['com.blake.readingeggs.android', 'com.vooks', 'com.brainpop.brainpopjuniorandroid', 'org.asiafoundation.letsread', 'com.chungchy.highlightslibraryglobal']",com.getepic.Epic,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.getepic.Epic&hl=en&gl=us,

Email us at quizletapp@quizlet.com, tweet us at @quizlet or check out our Instagram @quizlet too!<br>Love Quizlet? Why not leave us a review! :-)","[""My new favorite app. I legitimately didn't know the app inputs the word definition for me (you can do it manually if you want to), so I was pleasantly surprised. Whenever I hear new words, I write them into a little book I carry around, so I assumed I would have to type everything over again, but NOPE! This saves me so much precious time. And there are different quiz styles, and also a dark mode (some unnecessary fun). Just wish the pro version was cheaper, but of course, I am a cheapskate."", ""I like quizlet for studying vocab, but it is incredibly frustrating to me that my sets are organized on the app in a seemingly completely random fashion. It would be so nice if they were organized by, say, when they were made, or at least alphabetically. It's so bad that when I make folders, I have to add my sets one at a time to get them in the desired order, and I have to scour my list of sets every time to find each one."", 'Great, app. However, I wish it was as good as it used to be in some aspects. For learn, I wish it randomly gave you questions/cards instead of giving them in the order the creator made them. It\'s predictable how it is. I also miss the little progress bar and the emojis/sayings it would have after completing each session of learn. For instance ""You\'re really hitting your stride (with a skier emoji)"" That was a cute touch and also motivating.', 'This app is amazing! I studied for a test I had and it was so simple and easy to get it to work. I love the app although there is some pop up ads but there really not a problem. You can compete against friends im the matching option. It really made my life easier. Definitely recommend 👌', ""This app is so helpful when it comes to memorization for tests and quizzes at school. I use it to study Japanese and it even has features to help you fill in the blank in various languages which helps save some time when creating a study set. I've always struggled with my memory but I can say that quizlet has been an excellent tool and the perfect aid while learning Japanese. Thank you to whoever made quizlet, you deserve an award."", ""This app is wonderful. I am a pre-nursing student, I am able to put all my vocabulary terms and textbook definitions into Quizlet then use them as either flashcards, a matching game, or test myself. I'm in love. And this is for the free version! That ads aren't obnoxious or anything. I may invest in the paid version just because this is helping me so so much!"", ""Support refuses to acknowledge and fix obvious and intrusive issues, even when made aware of them in very rudimentary terms; so I can't properly utilize the app I pay to use. Can't edit cards during study mode. In edit mode, the card won't expand to accommodate entire term. Cards can't have pictures in term side. Picture terms show up as random sizes in study mode, often way too small. Sets downloaded don't work offline. Cards with pictures won't flip unless tapped on the very edge of the card."", ""I like quizlet because it's really easy to use but I do feel that they need to add more features, for example if you create a set with 500 cards why can't you add a feature that allows us to study select cards from the set, that way we wouldn't have to study the whole thing all at once, give us the choice to study the amount we want that would he awesome."", ""While the app is very helpful, being able to adjust the text placement and size of the text within the app would make it much more user friendly. Not everyone can see the text at the current size. I am using it to learn Thai and it is important to see enough detail to know which letter is which, but that's very hard to do as the app stands now. I would like to increase the text size and be able to choose the text to be centered whenever displayed to maximize use of the screen and legibility."", ""I think this app is very good especially for subjects where you have to memorize a lot of concepts. This app is especially useful for Anatomy, because Anatomy is full of difficult concepts, and there is plenty of information to memorize. I think Quizlet can also help with making good flashcards for anatomy to help with studying. Overall, it's a ln excellent app for Anatomy students as well as people in other difficult subjects. I would highly recommend this app to anybody!"", 'Its great for a free product. I know you can pay for it for added features, but the same thing still happens on your phone. When you run through your flashcards, swiping right or left to see what you know, it does not keep track if you accidentally shut down the application. It would be nice if you could have a progress save feature when signed in or allow the ability mark cards to study more of. I could not star the cards i was still studying.', ""Quizlet is enjoyable to use. It let's you choose what type of studying you are in the mood for, whether it is flashcards, a matching game, or it gets tougher by typing your answers. I've been playing for free for about a week now, but will be signing up soon. I figure if quizlet has kept me engaged and excited then it's definitely worth the small price for the year. Try it, it's awesome!"", 'It is broken, ""Learn"" does not reset, does not change from anything other than smart grading, and MAKES you do multiple choice. Can not get to simply ""learn"" with ""flashcards"". Due to multiple ""improvement updates"" now you literally can not study the way you need. AND this started mid November. Who in their right mind messes with study applications at the end of semester when tests are happening left and right??? And I\'m paying for plus. Awful', 'Flashcards aren\'t good for me, so whenever I study a set under the ""learn"" option, I\'ll turn off flashcards and leave written and multiple choice. This never actually turns off flashcards. Ever. If I go back into the settings, the flashcard switch is still off. Might be a dumb thing to worry about but it really bothers me.', ""Great app, could use more choices in colors for highlighting. I would like to be able to customize the font as far as color and size of font. App slows down if your flashcard set is too large. I've noticed that with over 400 flashcards in a set, the app tends to freeze."", 'Used it throughout college, med school, residency, and likely will continue during fellowship. Flashcards work well for me to reinforce concepts i get wrong or get confused between. Even the free version of the app is great, and lets u see what others have used as the description for terms. U can add pictures too. And wonderful to have the app to pull up flashcards and concepts as you are studying/ in the hospital to reinforce your learning in the real world. Definitely recommend!', ""If like using it on the computer/browser is still a lot nicer. You can actually do the matching portion of the test, which is the most common type of test that I get where I have to use Quizlet. At least on a browser, you are forgiven if you add a S to the end of a word compared to in the app they'll mark it wrong when it's really not. Overall, not bad! I just wish it didn't cost so much to get Quizlet plus or else I'd totally get it."", 'I really love quizlet. I bought the year subscription for no more than 50$ and i use it for all of my exams, and homework assignments. It is smart so it has even given me similar quizlets with information that is similar to the ones I have made or studied. It is the reason I am passing my exams, really helps with what schools want from students which is memorization of subjects.', ""I started using Quizlet again recently after a small hiatus this past semester. Before, I would have rated Quizlet as 4 stars; there's always room to improve. Now, I want to rate the app as 2.5 stars. I went to use the Learn mode and discovered that it no longer shuffles the information. This makes no sense as the shuffle served to enhance learning through the learning concept of interleaving practice — yes, spelled correctly. This mode's quality significantly decreased due to this removal."", 'I purchased Quizlet Plus for the offline access to study sets and -- Quizlet ""offline access"" doesn\'t actually mean ""offline access"". I still need an internet connection to load the sets (even after downloading each individual set as instructed in their Help Center). Quizlet is awesome but I\'m very disappointed in this quasi-offline access feature.', ""I'm in 9th grade and I have done so good on all my tests and quizzes. Even without Quizlet plus you can do Soo much and I appreciate that. And you get notifications and achievements when you have a new study set or you complete a week or so of studying. This escecially helps if you are an athlete and your trying to keep your grades up cause you can study anywhere. I love this app and will probably use it even in college.❤️"", ""Will always be my favorite. subscription isn't pricey and it really helps in studying. I've been using quizlet since 10th grade chemistry. I'm about to graduate with my Bachelor's thats how easy this app has made my studying. its easy to add the term and definitions, that even a 5 year old can easily access this site. I will be a Quizlet user till I no longer have to study (maybe never)!"", ""Often frustrating. You can't add study sets to folders through the app. You have to do it through the computer. Once sets are added through your desktop browser, it's a good app. When you are studying a large study set, don't navigate away from it for ANY reason - even to answer the phone. You have to start over EVERY time. Really frustrating when you get through 80/90 questions and you have to start over."", ""I learned how to actually study with flashcards from the app. It's helpful and even has extra exercises to encourage you to learn. There are modes of learning for all learners, visual, auditory, and tactile (you can type the answers, I personally found that option super helpful). Using it on both the computer and the app is great too. The computer lets you easily upload your terms and definitions in one go, and also provides some different activities and games to practice with. Super helpful."", ""They force you to accept all cookies before you can use the app since it is the only button that you can click to move forward. Incredibly scummy move and I'm pretty sure also illegal. Trying to change your preferences afterwards through the privacy policy section is difficult to find AND THEN it brings up the page where it forces you to aacept all of the cookies again. Disgraceful."", 'I mean, the desktop version is great. The app is buggy. It keeps showing me the definition side when I have it set to show the term. It does the same thing when I reverse the order to be shown first. Also, when I had this on my iPhone, it allowed me to download sets for offline viewing. Now on the android, it does not. Pretty disappointed and will be looking for a different app.', 'Great for learning on-the-go. Some features are different from the website version. (For instance, the asteroid game is not available, the matching game is easier because you tap with your fingers instead of dragging with a mouse, and the tests are given one question at a time with no ability to scroll back up and double check your answers before submitting.) But the most important features are all there and you can connect to your website account.', ""I really like to use this app to study specifically for medical terminology as it involves A LOT of terms to learn and memorize. My complaint is that it seems as if after you get past or close to around 100 terms, it becomes VERY laggy. It takes at least 10 seconds to go from one definition to the next term when typing them in. This causes a lot of frustration because the time that I have to wait for the cursor to go to the next thing adds up. All of my chapters have well over 100 terms each so this is something I have to deal with every single time I have a new chapter. I'm sure this wouldn't happen if I purchase the premium version, but I'm a broke college student that's just trying to study."", ""Cool flash cards, just what I was looking for. I really like the multiple options for how the cards and matching can be presented. Edit 2020-07-23 I like this app a lot, and I'm constantly using it. For now, I'm dropping to 4 stars because performance has been suffering. I'm seeing lots of bugs when rapidly switching between this app and others (like a browser)."", ""I've used Quizlet alot over the years. It's a simple, easy program that makes studying so much better. However, the new update kind of took away most of the cool features and replaced them with ads for a premium option. I didn't really like that because it made using the app harder. I personally have no problem with buying a premium feature, however, I know people who are students and can't really afford to pay for these things monthly."", ""I was confused at first, I usually use quizlet online. I thought that you had to pay for learning mode. I was upset, I downloaded the app and you didn't need to pay for it, it's free. You can pay for it if you want your custom study path. Also upset that when doing the learning mode, I think there should be a FREE option to put images for terms as well, or it can get confusing. That's all! The learning mode is the part that gets me excited the most to study! Having quizlet for 2 years! :)"", ""Quizlet is so helpful for studying vocabulary. Sometimes I make my own study sets but other times I use one that someone else made. I love that if I don't have time to make flashcards, I can start studying immediately and when I do make them, it helps even more when prepping for a test. I'm not particularly thrilled with the new font size. They're huge on my phone. I wish they had a way to control the size so people with impaired vision could have large fonts while others have small fonts."", ""So theoretically, Quizlet itself is a great study tool. Having it on my phone is great, and it's easily worth the money. However as an app, I cannot believe that I'm paying for something that runs soooo slow. I cannot navigate this app at this speed. Sometimes i have to wait over a minute to go from one page to another, and up to 5 minutes for a study set to load so i can even see what's in it. The concept is worth the money. The functionality is not."", ""It's a very useful app for studying or just learning in general. The one issue I think they have though is that the quizlet.live sessions aren't very stable, so there are frequent disconnects while playing with large amounts of people. Other than that I would recommend it to anyone who needs extra practice on a topic or needs to memorize something quickly."", ""I got through high school and college using Quizlet! There is no excuse as to not being able to study... It is as easy as opening Quizlet on your phone. I'm a very visual learner, so the flashcards and vocabulary make it very easy for me. Study at work, in your car, even in the dark when you're about to go to sleep! It's a great way to keep grades up."", ""Life-changing! Love Quizlet! I don't know what I'd do without it. It makes flashcard making so much faster. And, now I don't have to mess with carrying index cards around. Great for anatomy courses, because you can use photos. Developer suggestions: (1) I wish there were a way to select & copy specific cards from one set to another. (2) The mobile app does not allow editing a card while studying the set. (3) You cannot sort the cards alphabetically in editing mode."", 'I love this app, and will be using it for a long time! It makes studying easier. The only thing that could be changed is the folders. I love that we can organize sets by anything, but it can still be messy. A great update would be to allow users to make sections on their folders. For example, if they have a science folder, they could have a section in the folder on a topic or unit, and be able to study that whole section without the other off topic sets. I think this would be great! Thank you!', 'Only one significant short coming after months of heavy use...When using the testing feature, after selecting an answer to a multiple choice question, the displayed answer information is extremely good but it is cleared automatically before it is possible to read it when the questions are complex. There appears to be no way to wait for you to tap or otherwise signal that you are ready to continue. Very aggravating.', 'I wish that there was more that you can do with the free version, but I enjoy the app. I use it for all of my classes. I truly appreciate how organized that you can be with it all. Something that would be nice (unless i missed this option) would be the ability to color code the sets or have a multi color deck to be able the subtopics within a set.', ""I used this thing in the past and did really well with it. But this new version has removed functionality that has made it less effective. I credit previous versions of this for doing really well in my classes. I could study during a long commute because of the Play mode. I could study while rowing or jogging because of play mode. But it seems that the play option is gone. When you're a parent, you need to study when you can. Bring the play mode back! And landscape mode for flashcards!""]",False,"['com.studysmarter', 'com.quizizz_mobile', 'com.lexilize.fc', 'com.memrise.android.memrisecompanion', 'com.ichi2.anki']",com.quizlet.quizletandroid,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.quizlet.quizletandroid&hl=en&gl=us,

I am giving 4 stars because of the discord app."", ""The content and educators are really good. but there are so many problems with the interface. I would like to suggest some features 1. Watch History. 2. Mention subject of expertise under the educators name/profile 3. Option to save a particular video/lecture. Honestly, I would prefer youtube over the application to watch the lectures but paid videos aren't available on youtube. Please rethink the whole interface."", 'Poor optimization for tablets. Landscape mode results in black bars in the app. Since I use a tablet mostly, constantly changing orientations breaks the flow of a study session. Planner is a wonderful addition and a amazing tool to have. However, it is also poorly executed with very limited features to customize your schedule. Eg: Cannot reschedule classes to a later date if you missed some. Notes is an app only feature, and hence should be downloadable for offline viewing at the least.', 'Unacademy is the most useful app. Just get a subscription any you will never ever regret it. The user interface is quiet easy to use. Just one imptovement that could be made is to bring the option of participating in a live quiz from the website also, not just the app. All in all I am satisfied but just please look after the quiz feature as many of use desktops and laptops and it will become easier for us to join a quiz.', ""Other than Technical issues every thing is awesome. Majority of time it shows slow internet connection even when it's fast or moderate. All other apps work completely fine with my internet connection but unacademy app shows the issue.

It is not possible for a student to write notes in a class using your new feature in live or recorded class. Even it is very irritating to open the app all time for class or taking notes.

I took plus subscription for my JEE preparation and never regretted it. But there are some problems with this app. First, it is poorly optimised for Android tablets. This app can't even run in landscape mode. Second, we cannot save the screenshots (saved in the notes sections) offline. Third, I cannot access my screenshots saved in my notebook on the website. Fourth, I do not receive any notification when educators post anything in their community."", ""Teachers provided on this plateform are the best faculties in India, really have recognized degree in their sub. Also they have experience, maintain proper discipline. Overall, it's the great source of learning. It helps me a lot in my studies also save my time of travel while going to or coming from coaching institute."", ""Unacademy is my 1st choice for online learning but suddenly there is so much changes.The screenshot option is stop, the new iconic version where only iconic students talk with teacher and most of the time resolve their doubt, and the doubt solve section where most of the time they provide wrong solution. the screenshot option is resume soon it's impossible to write down notes everytime..But all teachers are very humble and hardworking and they provide good content for that reason I use this app."", ""Recently I found 2 bugs in unacademy platform... As well there is many more bugs like we can't able to open class from direct link which given by the any sir or madam. .

But nowadays I'm facing too much network issues even if the internet speed is good enough. Please fix the internet issue and also make the test series and tests be available at a single space so that no-one has to search overall to find a test."", ""I'm very happy that i have taken right decision to choose Unacademy subscription. Notes , Unacademy magazine , topic wise questions , test series and there is so much more. This is the best learning app. Thank you so much for providing such a beautiful learning app . I'm giving 5 rating because the new feature Unacademy has added that is raise hand where you can directly talk to the educator and clear your doubts. 😊😊"", 'The learning purpose is easily solved through this app. The concern is regarding the interface which is really messy. There are many feedback regarding this but unacademy has only one automated reply for every review. Please contact us instead as we are paying for your services. Hoping to get some quick response.', ""Very nice app.it bridged the gap btw bright teachers and curious,hard working students. I love it. But I hate it's working the developers and software engineers have made this app ridiculous. We are unable to use it properly 1. Clicking, any link shared by our teachers on yt. doesn't open the session, instead it just opens the home page of app. We again have to search for that class. 2. I've very good plan wifi.still I face interruption in live class,in middle of class, it gets paused,lag😡😡😡"", 'This is a suggestion from students like me who have taken subscription for multiple courses(goal) on unacademy it would be great if the unacademy team could provide us with a unified planner ie all classes from all opted goals in one single planner. It would be really helpful for us to manage classes and not forget any class. A single planner for all opted goals would help us plan time and notes efficiently without the fuzz of forgetting classes from different goals. Please do look into it.', ""It is really great app it's greatness increases with its plus subscription. In this lockdown period I being preparing for class 10 board CBSE it is really helping. It's always getting better and better every week. Now I am using it for Neet preparation and the whole faculty is superb 👍!! Thanks for you constant support, unacademy🌼"", 'Teaching is best! But i think the app experience can be improved more and more efficient for low end specs smartphones. And also please make the recording available of live lessons instantly like YouTube and please make the video playback features like YouTube... It will be very beneficial!', 'Various types of problems arises with online education. Some teachers are totally misleading and can develop a sense of unwilling to study in learners. Rest all features of the app are nice. But unacademy should include more teachers that can form a clear base of the topics and subjects rather than newbies who unknowingly confuses the learners much than clearing especially in subjects like physics and chem.', '1. Please provide proper download manager (play pause downloads, select multiple downloads to delete). 2. Add ""mark as complete"" option to classes, as after watching a class sometiomes it shows pending. E.g. a cancelles class has no study material and is of 10 mins only. We can\'t watch it for 10 mins. 3. Make app tour skippable. We have to watch it everytime after login.', ""My first experience was very good shame on you unacademy you are now not friendly for students.The new interface is very bad now it's not showing our ranks other than top 10, it has restricted taking screenshot the people who open this app in phone and laptop both has to face so much problem as every time we have to log in for only one device and the other logs out this is for free class also .It is biased to iconic subscription people."", ""I am using the app since very long, it helps me a lot in my study .The education is really very very good,but with the update i can't take the screenshot in free special classes ....it helps a lot for in learning & also time saving...I will suggest u guys to think about it and allow to take the screenshot"", 'I get it that this has many great teacher and great features BUT oh my god its so annoying to find proper lactures of proper topics, so many batchs with so many different course that are not even complete.

I think there's a lot of potential for this to be a great learning app but it seems to need significant technical repair before it can be helpful. So I do not recommend this app unless they get it fixed."", ""Keeps freezing! Can't get past a lesson for a week now because it keeps freezing in the same spot. Hate that they took off the ability to do the program on desktop. App is extremely buggy. Loved the program a couple of years ago, should have kept it that way. Unfortunately unsubscribing. Unacceptable. Edit: Still can't get past the same lesson 2 months later. Glad I unsubscribed."", ""Bought the subscription for the promo they're having to give back to kids. I used this as a trial a while ago and it worked great. Once legged in, it won't even take me to the home screen. It just has a constant loading screen. I've emailed them and haven't heard back yet (about 5 days ago). I've Uninstaller and reinstalled on multiple devices and still the same...just a loading page that never changes. Hopefully this gets fixed soon."", ""Gets stuck on the paint level every time. I feel bad leaving two stars for a trial of this program, which has clearly had a lot of thought and effort into it, but like many reviews i see on here, it just gets stuck on the paint level and stops progressing. I found a work around by logging in the website and turning off the track restriction for one level and turning it back on after that, but there's a lot of steps to be had. Any time you need to do something, you have to put your birthday in."", ""I've been having a problem even opening the app. It seems to crash. I just set my sons profile and pushed the continue button and my screen went to a loading screen. It had a picture of a field of hills and flowers and kept on turning back and forth on my phone. I've heard it advertised and have been really looking forward to downloading it please fix."", ""I can't get it to go past the letter A. We are stuck on the short video about CAKE! my kids have watched it so many times but it won't give them the blue ribbon and let us move on. Id really like to get this fixed so they can keep using this app. We are in the trial period of a 1 month subscription...going to cancel if not promptly resolved:( Updating my review...after reinstalling the app it finally let us move on.

Doesn't matter how many times I force quit and restart wont get out of that stage I even uninstalled and reinstalled. Such a joke. I don't understand how it's so highly recommended when it doesn't even work!"", ""Mostly my kid (3yo) really likes this app. The focus on phonics is helpful for him, and i really like that after each section completed there is an opportunity for kids to take a break by drawing or using the recording feature. The reason I am canceling is that there are times when Millie (usually very upbeat) is a bit harsh about wrong answers and it is really discouraging. He just can't seem to get past that, so we'll try another app until he's a bit older."", 'Several issues with the app. If my child accidentally presses the home button it doesnt save her progress. Doesnt show progress. I dont know how many leevels there are and id like to see their learning outline. Been using it for a while and i dont think they are retaining anything. Lessons are easy for them. My child thinks the lessons are boring.', ""I am using this for a 1/2 year old. The content is fine, but there are some issues. 1) Exit button is too accessible. 2) Small hands can't hold the screen without touching the edges, which confuses the app and keeps you from selecting answers. 3) Delay between the characters' instructions and letting users push answers. This confuses her and leads her to think her answers are wrong. 4) Some of the sticker and paint activities are silent / don't verbally say what the stickers or colors are."", ""I downloaded this app for my son. He seems to do pretty well with it, however there seems to be a lot of glitches with many different areas the pathway and we have not been through any of the other things yet. While reading stories parts of the words are covered up by the cat character the question at the end of the story the answers are partially cut off. We've had Parts where you have to pick the picture that matches the sound and none of the pictures match the sound. Those are just a few."", 'We used this app awhile ago and was great. Signed up again and it crashes ALL the time. My kids wont even try it anymore because they are so frustrated. I uninstalled every other single app on their kindle fires to ensure enough memory. And still crashes. My subscription renews at the end of the year and I will be canceling it if the issue isnt resolved.', ""We hate this app. It was okay at first, but my 4 year old is so bored with this and I have been having trouble canceling. The app almost never opens properly and my husband asks every month if I've been able to cancel it. I know others who have been charged even after cancelation confirmation. We are fed up with Homer and have found a better program that both meets and exceeds our expectations and supports academic excellence, confidence and progression."", 'So far the content is pretty good except for a slingshot of letters to the tower. Its completely bugged. If you launch letters to fast, it will stop talking and stop you from completing the exercise. Even taking time to complete slowly will sometimes still make you redo this. The exercise should be replaced with something else to avoid this frustration in the future. Please test and see for yourself.', ""My daughters loves this app and has really jumpstart her letter recognition. She enjoys it way more then abc mouse and is easier to navigate both for the parent and child.

It took almost a week and multiple emails on my end to have the issue resolved."", 'Not what I expected. I just downloaded the app yesterday and it keeps crashing. It takes a long time to load and I have to get out of app and get back in for it to work. Also, it does not work offline, which I though it did because I saw somewhere online that supposedly it did. The price differs too, since I saw it was $45 a year rather than $60. I would be canceling before my trial expires.', 'Best content of any kids learning game that I have downloaded by far. That being said, the game freezes up every two minutes. If you close out and re-open the game it works just fine for a couple minutes and then freezes up again. This would be fine, but progress within each lesson is lost making it frustrating for my son to have to repeat half of each lesson. I uninstalled after about an hour of dealing with this .', ""The program is good, when it works. It constantly is crashing, and not saving the place within a lesson is ridiculous. My daughter has done the same level 2, step 4 lesson 4 times because it freezes, restarts, etc. The content is very good, but if she can't get past the lesson, what good is it? I just paid yesterday, and I think I will be cancelling before my next payment."", ""Our app won't work and I emailed for help over a week ago with no response. It worked fine before and now freezes. Definitely a waste of money. Edit-they did respond shortly after I wrote this review, but after reading other reviews this seems to be a common problem with the app getting stuck in the reading path and not letting the student progress. I think it is with the new version of the app."", ""Update: The developer reached out and the app is working again. The progress issue appears to have resolved. Very satisfied and my daughter is enjoying the game again. My daughter loved this so much and definitely helping her learn. Then an update and things got weird, her progress was messed up and the layout was different. Some of the stories wouldnt load. Now the app won't even load.

I want to be able to have all 3 of them on the app. We are running into issue with the app staying open for the 3 year old. The older kids dont want to even deal with it because it keeps closing out. Please help me fix these issues for the 3 of them, thank you in advance!!', ""It is pretty good. BUT it has a song area and that all my kids want to do.. they get so mad at me for trying to keep them fouced on the work because they want to watch firetruck music videos. I was there was a way to customize the layout and option to remove things parents see as distracting. Also.. It crashes quit often and I can't find a way to skip past lessons that seem repetitive for my child."", 'The program does an excellent job of teaching children to read. Unfortunately, it frequently has errors that their IT seems to be unable to fix for weeks at a time. Technical support is never any help, just asks the same question, ""What OS are you using?"" which is always up to date. The issues always magically resolve themselves after several weeks.', ""I'm not certain why this app is rated so low. I would give it 6 stars if I could. I've finally found an app that holds my incoming Kindergartener's attention unlike ABCmouse and one account is good for 4 kids which is excellent for when my next child turns 2! I have ran into an issue, though. She started on my phone and when we moved to her tablet she lost her progress! Also, her catered preferences seem to be missing on her tablet as well because the lessons are completely different."", ""Downloaded for my son (6) and daughter (3), and they are loving it! We really like how it progresses through learning and has multiple teaching activities to keep things from getting boring. Also love the art and narration - way more interactive and organic than other learning apps. I'm excited to see how quickly my 3yo can learn to read, she's been asking to play every night so far, and making good progress!"", ""Definitely worth subscribing! I have two that weren't showing interest and were struggling with reading. Within a couple weeks, they are interested and excited to read by themselves! They are catching on much quicker than anything else we've tried. I wouldn't have believed that we would find something that works. We tried ABCmouse and that didn't hold their attention. I wish I would have subscribed to Homer a year ago, instead. Highly recommend!"", ""APP IS NOT WORKING. Glitches occasionally, and things do appear right, on the screen. My son and I have games not loading for us. We click on things over & over & certain games still don't load. Then for art, you can't erase the stickers... you can't delete them, you have to close out of the art game completely, and then go all the way back in just so you have a clean slate to do art work & drawing again. Very frustrating for my 3 year old with low patience tolerance. 💔 PLEASE FIX!"", ""Don't purchase, too many glitches, not worth it. We have two other subscription services but my 2 year old loves homer, unfortunately the app goes black while it's still talking numerous times in a single session of playing and is frustrating for both of us. I would uninstall this if it were free, certainly not worth paying for with these glitches."", ""I am cancelling before we can begin. I have been registered for 8 days now. The app has never worked on my Samsung S9 no matter how many times I uninstall & reinstall. I tried to load it on my desktop but it is not allowed even though the app store says my device is compatible. You can not use it via the internet (no cloud based option). So before we can even try it, we must delete it. It's a shocker that it is recommended by so many reputable sources, may be fraudulent. Makes me think twice about the whole reputability of the program."", 'Terrible experience. After paying, I was unable to access App. On April I contacted them directly to cancel service, but received an email saying they would reach out to me. They never contacted me. The next day I cancelled subscription renewal on Google play. However, I have been charged again. I tried contacting them again, and received another email saying they would reach out to me. Still waiting ... Disputing charge now with credit card.', 'App is great and fun for the kids when it works. Three stars bc most of the time it is very slow loading (turning on, switching activities, etc.) We are still using the app during the free trial but will be cancelling at the end due to how slow it is. Would give 5 stars if it was faster...', ""Never could get it to even work. App is perfectly fine up until the point you agree to the terms of the subscription to the fee, then suddenly it can't find your email, doesn't load or just can't locate your information even though you have a receipt from Google. The one positive is that you can easily unsubscribe from Google play apps and very easily delete the app. Never got to see the app actually work and couldn't even get it to the point my son could actually use it. Waste of my time."", 'My son really liked the app. He played it every day. And just in the few weeks we had it installed, I saw improvement. Biggest downfall, it was constantly ""loading."" Like a video buffering but never finishing. We have LG products. Son would get tired of constantly waiting to play. I got tired of trying to fix it.', ""I really wanna love this app because I hear good things about it , but the games and other exercises will not load it just goes to a white screen. I've checked my connection and its good and my other apps are loading just fine its just this app. I've uninstall and installed the app about 3 or 4 times and still having the same problems. I've tried to email you guys but the email that's on the customer help page is wrong somehow."", ""I was so excited about downloading this app. I have a 2 year old that's pretty advanced, and I'm running out of ideas as far as where to start next. So I heard about Homer, and once I downloaded it, and did the questionnaire that's as far as the app let me get. I uninstalled and reinstalled it, and it goes to the homescreen and continuously says loading. Please fix so I can actually try the app and give a better rating. By the way I have a Samsung Tab A."", 'There needs to be a confirmation prompt when hitting the back arrow in the upper left hand corner during a lesson. My son constantly bumps it unintentionally in the middle of a lesson and it goes back to the map losing his progress and making him start over. Not worth the money. At least if no prompt then save the spot in the lesson instead of forcing the user to restart the entire thing.', 'This was a great app at first. The content was perfect for my kids but then the app stopped letting me log in. I uninstalled and reinstalled, I contacted customer support, I tried to change my password, and again contacted customer support. It has been months and I have had zero contact from them and cannot cancel the subscription nor can I access the app. I am highly dissatisfied and quite upset at this point.', ""Can't Access Learning Path! The other things work fine but when I click on either of the learning path buttons, a pale pink screen appears with nothing on it. At 1st, I thought it just needed time to load so I waited. An hour later and still nothing appeared. I've emailed a few days ago but haven't heard anything back yet."", 'Infuriating! I installed this in the car on the side of the road while on a road trip with a 4 year old. I was desperate to find something to keep him occupied during the long ride. I could not ever get it set up to work (warning, it requires detailed set up time) nor could I delete the year long subscription until the end of paying monthly for an unworkable (for me) AP. I fumed every month when I saw that charge appear on my AmEx card. Infuriating to be stuck paying for a useless AP for a full year.', 'I give this app 0 stars! Because i was excited after seeing the ads about it and my son really needs help with reading so i downloaded it on both my cell phone and my sons tablet and on both devices i open the app and all it does is load!

Err…","[""It feels like slow progress, going over things I've gotten right many times before. Likely that's what it takes for vocabulary and usage to become second nature. Great variety of approaches - definitions, comprehension, composition, spelling, and so on. I also like that it comes at the material both starting from the English and starting from the French, and gives the original, literal translation, and the vernacular. I think all that helps create a more immediate and instinctive understanding."", ""I love like all the content on this app -- history, art, music, flags. It's so much more than just languages! Of course, it has a lot of languages, too, with multiple levels. Oddly, I can't load anything but the languages from the app; I have to open my account in a browser. And the app can be a little twitchy, which I've found I can get around by clicking the Learn button. So, not perfect, but I use it every day and recommend it for any class you're taking, or for general learning."", ""Memrise is a nice app, however there are some shortcomings. Pronunciation is terrible. Some speakers don't enunciate well so it is difficult to understand them. You hear 3 different speakers say the same thing 3 different ways. Which one do I learn? On some exercises, they leave out the correct sequence of words as well as pronunciation. Memrise is useful, but you will have to learn correct pronunciation elswhere."", 'So far so good, learning alot! I grew up hearing Spanish my whole life, but sadly never learned to speak it. I understand alot if its not said too fast. This app is really helping me put things into perspective, with all the different forms of words and how to use them. My comprehension has definitely improved since using this app and my vocabulary as well. I also like the way things get mixed up but with repetition, verbally, written, and vocally. It really helps me learn! Def give it a try!', ""It's not bad. I used it for about a few days, missed a day or two. Do like the idea of the little clips - it's nice to hear conversations in German. Just subscribed so we'll see what that's like. ETA I knocked down a couple stars. Probably doing something wrong but am not noticing any difference between the free version and having a subscription. All the content/features seems to be the exact same."", ""I've been using this app for a few years now and while it's especially a flashcard style language learning app. It has been good for 1. A free app and 2. And random words that my books or teacher may not normally think to include (looking at you- bald head in Korean 2). The reason for the mediocre star rating? A recent update has changed so that in between sets of practice I get full page ads that include sound/video. I really don't want to see male hormone commercials when trying to study."", 'Fun and super helpful app! Only improvements I would like to see are that every course has all options available when paying for premium (listening with locals, etc are sometimes only on certain courses), and that it was easier to search for non languages courses /to make your own course from the app (instead of the desktop page) like it used to be. Otherwise, though, an awesome learning app for languages and/so/ much more!', ""This app is great for vocabulary and phrases, and a nice alternative to Anki if you don't want to spend much time setting up flashcards. Although I do recommend using the website and other resources as well, and not solely just the app. Highly recommend this for those who want to expand their vocabulary and get exposed to native pronunciation, which are both often overlooked in learning languages."", ""This app is fine but incredibly poorly supported for a paid version. For some reason my username and password stopped working. I requested to reset my password. The app stated an email was sent. No email has been received. Checked spam, etc. When I signed up for my pro account it took two or three weeks to hear back from customer service. I suspect the same thing will happen now since I've never received a password reset email."", ""The app is very bare bones, there just isn't enough available or helpful in learning a new language. It's just a flashcard app, there is no grammar training. Because of this, it isn't worth paying for premium despite the year-round offers of 50% off. And now that they've added long, obnoxiously loud advertisements between every review, It's just not worth downloading. Uninstalling today after the latest ad update."", ""I've been using this app for nearly 7 years.It has helped me memorize so many words and I like the way the app looks. Having a leaderboard/scoreboard really helps motivate me to study. I can't stop using it! It would be great if the difficult words wasn't part of Memrise Pro. It would also be nice if my keyboard automatically appeared when doing the tapping test as it use to years ago. 11.26.2021 Now has full-page ads. (was 4-stars)"", 'I am enjoying learning with this app. The words and phrases are repeated frequently enough with words I just learned that it keeps wverything fresh. I can record myself speaking the words and phrases I learn. I can also listen to different people saying the words I am learning, and at different speeds. This helps me figure out what is being said easier. This is fun!', ""I'm doing the Spanish training and I like it. There's enough repetition in every format to help me learn but not so much that it becomes tedious. I like that you can hear it said by native speakers in a real world setting. I took Spanish for two years in school but couldn't actually apply it in the real world, so I forgot most of it. This app is really good at teach practical words and phrases you'll actually use in real life."", ""I'm trying to become fluent in French so I've been using several different resources. This one is unique because it really exposes you to the different ways people may speak one language. I'm not a beginner in French and started in French II, but I went back to French I to learn more common phrases. No one resource will teach you a language, but this one is incredibly useful for listening and conversational skills."", 'I am using it for French, and can comment on that language only. I have been enjoying it the most of any language learning app so far! I am using it along with Duolingo, and I also use the Toucan extension on my laptop. I would recommend this combination. Especially if you only wanted to pay for one program, get this one and use the free versions of Toucan and Duolingo. Nothing can replace classes with a native speaker, but for learning a language in just minutes a day this combination works.', ""This app is completely unusable unless you buy the paid version. Sure, it's free to download but it's not free to use. There's no point in downloading it if you already have a paid program you're using and you're just looking for some free supplementation, which is my case. This app really shouldn't be advertised as free since it's completely unusable without paying."", ""Great app. I feel it's much better than the free ones and a lot cheaper than most pay-to-use ones. I do this alongside the free version of Duo-lingo and feel I'm getting a really great grasp on Castillian Spanish. I'm not sure why one poster said you pay for each lesson. I paid a fairly modest one-time fee for the year, and it comes down to less than $0.25 per lesson...avout a quarter of that if you do review lessons over an over again, as I do."", ""I really enjoy this app! I feel motivated, and I am learning with an app without dropping or just giving up for the first time! It's incredibly engaging! I definitely recommend this app! (I'm a native Spanish speaker, a certified English Teacher, and a Medical Interpreter.) My question is: Can I (or could you please add this feature?) change the app's interface language from English to Spanish? It would make my learning experience even smoother! Thank you!"", 'Great app! I have this and Busuu to accompany my Textbooks, in learning Japanese. I love how this app has real native speaker clips, with a variety of accents and voice types saying the terms. I also really love the pronunciation practice feature. This is the most true to native modern Japanese learning program I found, that is not just formal Japanese, but a good mix with real context and great content! Would definitely recommend!', ""I've only used this app for a few days but I really like it so far. It includes words and phrases that I haven't seen in other apps (for casual conversation) and I really like the videos of native speakers. Some of the native speakers are hard for me to understand but I'm expectinging this will get my ears attuned to the way native speakers talk."", ""This was a good app when you had the option of learning a language for free, albeit far more slowly than the paid version. Now you get a couple of lessons to get your feet wet, so to speak. Really? You might as well take away those joke lessons entirely; it's utterly pointless. I left Memrise for Duolingo."", ""I bought the Black Friday lifetime deal and am thrilled. I've used this for years and I love where it has ended up. I have Speaktribe, Speakly, Mondly, Duolingo, Clozemaster, Busuu, Beelingua, Quizlet, Lingua, etc. Memrise and Quizlet are my two favorite, most used, most useful language apps in conjunction with Duolingo. Sometimes the simplest is the best. The UI is good for RSI or people who have hand disabilities or simply don't like too much clicking. It autoadvances and is flexible about answering. I love it."", ""Update: Very sad to see that I have to pay for a ton of options that used to be free to users. I've been on the app for over 4 years and enjoyed how much I have been learning, but now I have to move on to something that I can have the full experience of :( Old rating: 5⭐I do miss the old layout with the pretty colors and rocket ships. It felt more comfortable, but those don't matter! This app is awesome and I learn so much from it. The best 💜💙💚"", ""I love this app and website. Have been using them for years. However the app has not been syncing to the website lately. I restarted a course on the website, because the app doesn't have that function. But the app still has me at my old level, and will not update to show the restart. Even after uninstalling, reinstalling, logging out and logging back in."", ""I've had a subscription for two years now, but haven't been using the app much. I finally decided to jump back in and the new theme was a huge shock. Very loud colors on all white, in stark contrast to the old, relaxing space theme. Even the animations are more jarring, much less smooth than before. I want to say that I could get past this, but, going through the lessons is no longer enjoyable, so I may have to go back to Duolingo. An option to choose themes (or revert versiona) would be great!"", 'I liked the app itself and am a subscriber. That said, the redesign is really bad. It might be fashionable, but it distracts from the learning process, it makes it hard to read the text, and it makes precious seconds in timed tasks get lost in trying to visually parse design elements. It is not good when your UI undermines the very reason your application is there. If I just tried MemRise out for the first time, I would not have stuck with it.', ""The introduction to Japanese was amazingly clear and organized, they removed a lot of user created lessons though which I think was due to the lack of organization in them. Other than that, the price is a little steep if you don't catch a special offer, but if the lessons went even further and more in depth than a brushing of the surface that I've experienced, it might be considerable. If you're looking for a full immersion, you might as well pay full price for a legit course instead of an app."", 'While the learning function is excellent, I\'m changing my review from 5 to 2 stars because the new design is absolutley terrible. It\'s a huge step backwards from its previous charming spaceship theme that made the journey of learning languages feel so fun. The new design looks like a boring app that tried to be cool with the kids. If the intention was to be more ""grown-up"", it has failed spectacularly. At least make it so that the users have the option of switching back to the ""classic"" design.', ""App says it's free, but not even close. It only gives a very short intro to courses. my thing is, why am I going to pay ($30 BUT IT'S ONLY GOOD FOR TODAY!) however much it's supposed to go up to a year when I can't even preview the premium services? even one or two examples of each would make the sale. There is plenty of competition out there. uninstalled."", ""I really like the app, and although I'm not a huge fan of the all the design changes, I'm sure I'll get used to it. But, the new screen for introducing words/phrase for the 1st time is terrible. It's such a big change from the last layout that I no longer properly take note of the words because its a not consistent with the layouts of subsequent pages. My eyes now have to hunt for the translation of the word. As someone who's been using the app a lot, this is almost a breaking change. Please fix"", ""Like other reviewers I'm sorry to be finally writing a review like this after cancelling my subscription.  I used to really like Memrise as a handy and fun learning toll to keep my brain active by learning some Japanese and Spanish. It looked nice and I liked the space theme and calming blue colours. There were some things I'd have liked to see improved, e.g. more grammar, a list of all the content for a course instead of just each module, the ability to make your own modules from the words in the course rather than just flag difficult words, the ability to adjust the speed of the timed questions and time to review the response to your answer before it disappeared. But it was good. The new update is (a) hideous, and (b) broken. The black and yellow theme is awful and subconsciously aversive (like wasps). Some of the content is also now broken: you cannot scroll down the video on my phone to reach the letters you need to answer the question, which was not a problem before, so I just have to skip it! Some videos/questions also just don't load at all!  And it's going up in price?! No thank you."", 'As of now, I can only rate the free version. I am considering buying the yearly subscription, in part because of the good price ($3ish per month) but also because the app functions well, is easy to navigate, and the coursework is presented in a way that is easier (for me, anyway) to remember and use. Hearing AND seeing the native speakers has also been very helpful.', ""Pretty great overall as a learning platform, definitely one of the best if you go PRO. The free version will limit the level to which you learn a course, which is frustrating if you are trying to use this as a teacher with a classroom. Creating new courses still feels a bit primitive, but isn't too hard. One thing I would like to see change is the ability to browse and select courses in the app. Currently there is only a list of languages to choose from, and you need to visit the webpage to search through all subjects."", ""Was surprised to see any negative reviews about this app. I love Memrise and have subscribed for almost a year. Perfect for anyone that learns through memorization and repitition. I'll get on the treadmill at the gym and practice my Korean, the layout is so easy to use and you can turn sound off and still study. The new look really doesn't make a difference to me, still cute space stuff which is nice. I love the locals study, really fun and helpful to hear locals speak. Keep up the good work!"", ""I don't get the high rating. The layout is poorly designed and you're bombarded with offers to upgrade. Because of the design, its difficult to even figure out how to continue for free past three words/phrases. Maybe that's on purpose. Then about a dozen words/phrases in, the on screenini keyboard wouldnt accept any typing anymore to type the answer, so it's stuck. Thats a bug, I assume. I think I could do better learning from websites."", ""When you take away the new look Memrise is an awesome app for language learning. Being able the amount each lesson is extremely helpful if you're feeling overwhelmed. Enjoying features like the Locals, and being able to focus on difficult words or pronunciation. However, like I've seen already, the new look is a big turnoff for most people. Personally, it's too white and the green doesn't fit wherever you put it. Maybe try putting in a dark theme, that works well. Also change the flowers, yuck."", 'pretty good learning app. I also pair it with duolingo and switch off when I start getting annoyed/bored. Also, the dude they found for the beginner level of Japanese is just absolutely incredible. I laugh everything, which coincidentally makes it more memorable. Be warned that sometimes the audio quality will vary between people on ""learn with locals"" and it can be difficult to pick up on if you don\'t already have a basic understanding of the language structure in the first place.', ""The material seems good, but it's not user friendly. I'm having a very hard time following the menus and understanding how the lessons progress and what needs to be done or redone to advance. It's very busy visually and lacks organization and clarity. Duolingo is waaay more user friendly and organized. Too bad Memrise is so hard to follow because it sounds like it's better for building vocab. Unfortunately I'm too frazzled by the disorganization, so I won't likely be using it."", 'Currently the only issues I\'m having with this app is not being able to replay audio in the planting memories portion (it plays after I\'ve ""Continued"" tho). Also, when given three audio options to choose from, only one option actually plays an audio file. My partner also has these issues. Otherwise, love the app. I\'ve used Memrise for several years and have never been disappointed. The new look isn\'t my favorite but its not bad.', 'I was on vacation in Mexico talking to a drunk lady, when our mutual waiter walked up, and she started speaking fluent Spanish. She said she learned mostly on this app, and since downloading it, I have progressed greatly! Highly recommend. My only complaint, is that when you do the little word quizzes, I would like to be able to click on the false words and find out their definition. I think that would be more helpful than focusing only on the 7 or so words in each lesson.']",False,"['com.languagedrops.drops.international', 'air.com.rosettastone.mobile.CoursePlayer', 'com.busuu.android.enc', 'com.atistudios.mondly.languages', 'com.babbel.mobile.android.en']",com.memrise.android.memrisecompanion,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.memrise.android.memrisecompanion&hl=en&gl=us,

Preschoolers, kindergarteners, toddlers, and older kids are eager to learn their ABCs, counting, addition, subtraction, and more! The best way to encourage that is to share smart, well-made educational apps and games with them on a daily basis.

Math Kids is a free learning game designed to teach young children numbers and mathematics. It features several mini-games that toddlers and pre-K kids will love to play, and the more they do the better their math skills will become! Math Kids will help preschoolers, kindergarteners, 1st graders to learn to identify numbers and start training with addition and subtraction puzzles. They'll have a great time completing games and earning stickers, and you‘ll have a great time watching them grow and learn.

Math Kids features a number of puzzles that teach while your child plays, including:
• Counting - Learn to count objects in this simple game of addition.
• Compare - Children can build their counting and comparing skills to see which group of items is bigger or smaller.
• Adding Puzzle - A fun mini-game where kids create math problems by dragging numbers on the screen.
• Adding Fun - Count the objects and tap on the missing number.
• Adding Quiz - Put your child's math and addition skills to the test.

• Subtracting Quiz - See how much your child has improved in their mathematics skills for subtraction.

When kids can play while they're learning, they're much more likely to recall information. It also makes them want to learn more frequently, which will give them a huge boost when they start kindergarten.

Math Kids also comes with a number of features that help adults monitor and manage their child's progress. Customize game modes to increase or decrease the difficulty, or check report cards to see scores for previous rounds.

Math Kids is the perfect introduction to the basics of counting, addition, and subtraction. It will teach your toddler, kindergartener, 1st grader sorting, and logical skills along with early mathematics, giving them the perfect foundation for a lifetime of learning.

Note to Parents:
When creating Math Kids, we focused on building the best possible learning experience for children of all ages. We're parents ourselves, so we know exactly what makes a good educational game, as well as what doesn't. We released Kids Math as a completely free game with no in-app purchases or third party ads. Math Kids is full featured, frustration free, and ready to go. It’s exactly the kind of educational app we want for our children, and we think your family will enjoy it, too!

It's great for preschoolers. It is simple, effective, and encouraging as the child learns. Above all it is fun learning numbers and math with this app. I love there are NO ADS to interrupt and distract the child while they're learning. Thank you for developing this free learning app for children.👍😃"", ""It was absolutely great for kids, it's very helpful for kids it gives them access to have the knowledge of mathematics since at their beginning, you are great 💯"", 'Hello, could you please help me with turning off the answer clue feature. I would like for app not to help with the answer. Other than that its so great. I just really would love for my kid to figure it out by himself. Thank you very much❤❤❤', ""It is a fun math game and it helps you learn addition and subtraction and it is good for education it is good for 1st graders and up and for all ages and for children and kids who can't go to school/have a good education and your children will be happy and there are no ads and it's free and there are no problems at all"", ""My daughter loves this app and I am installing it on a third device along with other RV apps. It's a treat to play for her and she is seriously learning."", 'I am 10 years old and i thought it said up to the age of 12 well. I thought lets give it a try. So i tried it. Within 2 mins i uninstalled the game. It was giving me questions like 2 plus 3 and i thought this game should say up to the age of 6. I highly do not reccomend this rubbbish app.....', ""It's a great game for kids to learn maths my brother is learning gradually this game is so great for kids it helps kids to learn maths definitely am giving this game ( 5 ) five stars"", 'Great app for kids to practice with. Entertains for a really good amount of time while being decently educational.', 'Best app maker for kids! On top of that they have french language option NO ADS! Thank u very much developer/s', 'Their apps are always top notch. From their puzzle games which I used to teach my son to comprehend order, to their spelling games (he now can read 14 character words at 4.5yrs), I honestly can not fault their apps. Is this game 100% perfect...no, but its possibly one of the best ways to teach your kids to count in conjunction with some number blocks.', 'This is a great app with visually appealing graphics, making it kid-friendly and fun. One suggestion would be to add more number range levels. The current levels allow for 0-5, 0-10 and 0-20, while it would be good to add ranges 5-10, 5-15, 10-15 and 15-20 as well. That way, more advanced learners could practice their skills in the higher number ranges. Furthermore, the app is fantastic. Well done! :-)', ""Wow! This reminds me of YouVersion because it's completely free. Thank you everyone for making this possible!"", 'Amazing game. Noads, absoluteky free and helpful. Wish there are more games like this one. Only one suggestion I would like to add is that in rhe counting section, when the kids touch the objects, the number is counted out aloud and it somewhat hinders the process of counting for the kid. It will be wonderful if we have an option to disable/enable it. Thank you.', 'Cool, I am not a toddler or a preschooler, I am a pupil that this year 2022 goes at 4th grade and I have a twin brother that is only one minute older than me and I enjoy this!', 'Very nice application it helps to learned solving by the age of 3 to 10 years old children.', 'The best educational app that I have found for my 4 year old grandson.', 'THANKS TO THIS APP. My little brother is learning numbers like (Counting,addition, subtraction, multiplication, and finally division) that make me and my family very happy', 'I have used your language app earlier to introduce sounds to my kid. I really appreciate your effort. In this math app Addition works perfectly. But the animation for subtraction is a bit confusing for the kids. Instead of fading away on its own, if you can change it to kids striking it off or vanishing away after the kids touch it might help the kids better understand ""take away"" concept.', 'Nice options: different games, difficulty levels, languages. Well translated to French for the most part. Kids love the stickers. 20 different profiles can be created which can be great for pre-k/ kindergarten classes. No adds, can customise available options to kids. Nice place to submit translation mistakes. Great app, and Free!!', 'Exiting the game is impossible. Why is it so? Its just a game. If you needed security, you could have designed better one. ********* Based on your response...the feature you described does not consistently work. So, i have to restart my device half the time. While it is hard to complain about free tool, i think it could be improved.', ""TRULY FREE. It has a cute theme with cute effects. i like that it's not so easy for them to exit each lesson. i like that i can better monitor that she's using it as a tool and not just trying one or 2 and telling me she did them all and is bored....... XD also the settings to allow which lessons you want them to access is awesome. they thought of some neat stuff. Altogether straightforward. easy to use. not very frilly. my daughter is 4 , but would be appropriate for 3-7 in my opinion"", 'Great app. Would be 5 stars if the drag and drop function worked with air mouse remote for Android TV box. My kids love to play games on the TV large screen but your game does not respond to the button press. Funny that the close button drag works but not the numbers/answers. It will be great if you can get this to work. Thank you', ""The sound no longer works on my android device. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app. I've also downloaded other apps from this company, there is no sound with them either. The sound on other apps on my device work. And the sound on the math kids app works on my ios device."", ""I thought this was pretty good until it kept telling my son he was incorrect when he arranged the equation as 3-3=0. The app was looking for 3-0=3 but gave no indication of that. Both are correct but his answer seems more logical. Who tries to subtract zero? It should accept both answers or indicate it's looking for one answer specifically, it definitely shouldn't declare a correct answer as incorrect!"", ""It changed to some Eastern European language and I have no idea how to change it back. Getting into settings requires a code that I obviously can't read on the screen. We love the app especially with no ads, but this is a little silly. It's still 5 stars, but I would appreciate some help getting it back to English."", ""I love all your games. The only limitation I have with your apps is that my kids love to play games on android tv box for that large screen or board experience. But your controls don't work with android air mouse. It will be great if you can make the controls work with android tv box. Thank you."", ""So far it looks good and my daughter seems to like the looks of it so far too....hope it's as good as it seems to be. I love the fact it says no adds and no in app purchases because kids this young dont understand things may look like they're good to download but end up costing us parents a lot and the child doesn't even realize that they just costed us a bunch of money just to play the games they downloaded but the best part is this is educational so they get to learn and for free."", 'The child gets confused when comparing 8 small candies and one big candy. According to his logic, one big candy is more than 8 small ones. Why can\'t all items be made the same size? It is incredibly difficult to explain this to a child. In addition to this, ""motivating"" exclamations like ""I believe in you!"" only distract the child when he solves an exercise. I would like to disable this feature. In general, a good application, but there are significant disadvantages, therefore 3 stars.', 'love the app and my daughters (7 and 5 years old) love it as well. My oldest greatly improved her math skills and quite rapidly. Also available in French (we are francophones). They love to collect stickers and stamps, and I can print certificates and activity sheets for them. Just amazing!!!', ""This is an amazing app that deserves 5 stars. I'm a single mom of 4 children (aged 9, 7, 6, and 4). We switched to homeschool and use this (and other apps by this creator) daily. My 9yo actually asked me to add it to his device! I've seen a great improvement in their addition/subtraction skills from just ten mins a day in each add and subtract quizzes. BUT the children have complained that the stickers/prizes they earn are not permanent, they disappear when they get back to that reward screen"", 'My children love this app! They are 4 & 6, and have been using it for about two years on/off. Math can be fun if we speak positively about it and create fun and natural environments to learn it, no force. This helped my children spark curiosity for math, and the love has grown from there.', ""My child is in year 1, and enjoying this app so far, however she is getting annoyed at having to wait for the character to say the sum or the word of the sum, before she can answer.. sometimes shes fast at the sum and it would be good to be able to encourage that. Also, this app says it's up to age 12, are the sums going to keep getting harder and harder? Or are we expecting 12 yr olds to continually answer what 2+1 is? If it does go higher, is there an age bracket button we can use ?"", ""My 2-yro son is being homeschooled, and now hes also learning mathematics! This is an excellent start. He is doing so well, and he loves to learn now thanks to you! Math may not be fun for older kids, but this is guiding him through! It's like an adventure for him, hes so happy and eager to play this every morning! Bless your company for this! No ads or in app purchases! Highly recommended for parents!❤👍"", 'I find that because there is no sense of getting it right or wrong, they just try all the answers until one is correct. There is also no sense of progress before getting a sticker etc. The end result is that there is no game element and they get bored within 20 questions.', 'This game is a little tricky. I find it difficult sometimes.', 'This very good app for kids. I like it. But can you please add math test feature if possible. Also is there any multiple and division option? I want that my sister learn how to do multiplication and division. Or do you have any other game in which we can learn it. If not please add it. Thank you.🙂🙂🇧🇩🇧🇩.', ""Haven't tried it yet but already downloaded for my child.. having read your mission makes me so grateful providing free app for kids without the need to pay for it and what's more fascinating is that the 0 zero add in your application. Realizing that kids not need this ads and you are just providing them the materials that they need to become better and better.. I believe that serving others makes you successful..and the more you give back and the more people you serve the more successful ul b!"", 'This math for kid is cool my little sister is very happy to play and learn this', 'Hey Lucas and Ruby! I just wanna say thank you for making this, and your other apps. It really helps my little brother a lot. Actually I think your apps were one of the reasons why my little brother did it on top in his class since the first quarter, and now its their graduation, and proud to say that he got the second spot as the brightest kid in his class.

It's not necessary but it takes a lot of the stuff that would make the game more enjoyable like why include the idea of evolving your pets if you have to pay for it and how a lot of the cool and better stuff also needs membership and it's advertised to you at every turn. Good game but Its kinda dampens the experience with so much stuff locked"", ""Great app for math! It's so fun and cool. At first, I thought Prodigy was just one of those math apps with a lot of commercials and it was no fun whatsoever. But oh boy was I wrong! I love the arcade like-style and graphics! I also love Noot, he's super cute! Don't get me started on the character customization! I absolutely LOVE it! While you can't change the outfit, you can change the hair, hair color, eye color and skin color! Overall it's a great, underrated, math game!"", ""It is a really fun and educational game that people of all ages can enjoy. The cool creatures, different spells, the type system, it is all very captivating elements of the game. The only thing wrong is the membership. You cant climb the tower, you can't evolve pets, and after you get eight pets, you can't catch anymore. It makes it very frustrating. I have my main pets evolved only because I was part of the game back when you could evolve pets and have several in your party. Please fix this."", ""I really like this game. Everything is appealing, the game is challenging and fun, and the custom character creation is great! However, there's a major problem with this game now. That problem is the fact you can't experience 70% of the game without premium. For example, to buy Medium or better houses, rescue more pets or even evolve them, you must pay a monthly fee. Please, JUST PLEASE CHANGE THS! #MakeProdigyGreatAgain"", ""For an app that is required by their teachers, my kids adore this program. It makes learning math fun! Combining customizable characters with adventure, battles with monsters and the ability to play online with classmates, it's an absolutely perfect way to get your grade-schooler to WANT to learn math. The problems are appropriate to grade level while also throwing in some easy ones to keep their minds sharp (and remind them of how much they've learned). It's a math game they ask to play!"", ""I played prodigy since I was in 4th grade and it was the best thing ever. Overtime, there was a few updates like the layout of the game but it was still fun nevertheless. Then an update happened that made me hate prodigy forever. Battles, completely different! Spells/gear, completely different! And the worst of all, I can't evolve my pets without paying for the membership! The membership is way too pricey for all of that! I wish prodigy would go back to the way it was when it first came out."", ""I really love Prodigy, I really do! But, I just HATE the fact that we have to be a member to evolve pets, and climb the Dark Tower. Also, can you at least make the rescue pet option for free after wasting other pets on it? It's annoying, and unfair. I play this at school sometimes, and other classmates can agree, some of them even quit because mostly everything needs membership. I understand you need to make money, but, if you want to have more people playing your game, make it fun and free!"", ""Its good, but it is not the best it could be. There should be ways to have free membership. If I'm battling a member at even a lower level they beat me by a lot. I feel that member stars shouldn't be a thing and that a lot more items and evolving available for everyone . The multiple currencies is very confusing. Could there be currency exchanges? The arena is confusing and the top 10,000 should get the pets. Beyond that its a game that I never get bored at. There's always something going on!"", ""Although the game is fun because you can collect items, make friends, battle other people, and own a house, it is really agitating when I am doing the dark tower. The game crashes when I am in the middle of battling. In order for the dark tower to save where you are, you must be on a level that ends with '1' or '6'. And when you crash, you have to start at the previous saved level. I find this really inconvenient because I only have membership for a few days and I want to reach level 100."", 'Really cool game! It makes learning a little more fun. My son, who\'s in another state, and I play together and do ""battles"" together. And even at 34, I\'ve actually improved at math since playing with him lol. You forget a lot after 22 years! My only criticism is it\'s too easy to avoid doing math problems by using the game more as a social media type thing, or play around with other people on thr game. Simpler math problems should pop up every 5 minutes IMO.', ""As a teacher, I use Prodigy as a station. We had a district-wide competition and so I would tie to a read-aloud during my library time. It was great fun! When I was in the classroom, I would use it to change up instruction and support my students' Individual Education Plan's instructional goals. Thank you for creating this free resource for teachers/students."", ""It was a really fun game. I really liked it, but the new looks for the monsters and characters and stuff just don't look as good as they used to. Same with the login page. I know it's probably changed for littler kids, which is why I'd like to propose a new idea to make the game more interesting. (Maybe) you can change the graphics of the game and stuff depending on the age of the player. Also, Could you stop showing so many ads about the stupid membership, And come out with updates more often?"", 'Decent game. Would recomend 7-14. Lots of things you can get to dress up your wizard/sorceress. Theres also dancing and a chat box though its extreamly limited to the game content and optimistic phrases which is a little annoying at times. But a lot of things are limited to memebers-only, please loosen the options for non-members a little bit! Sometimes the questions are worded weirdly. Overall, great game! Prodigy makes learning math fun!', 'I love the game. The only problem I have is the bounty board. It keeps putting monsters in really hard places to find. Also, could you bring back the lost island. I am level 100 and would really like to see it. I would also love to see shivertusk. It makes it so that nonmembers can find it but not catch it, but members can catch it, but not find it. Please fix this and I will raise my rate.', ""We did a month trial at first. My daughter liked it so much that we decided to purchase the premium membership (annual). It worked great at first but now my daughter gets frustrated that it kept on freezing/ stops in the middle of her battle/or just totally shuts down. She gets mad that she has to restart app then do the problem all over again. We used multiple tablets to see if that's what causing the problem and it wasn't. Pls. fix Asap"", 'My 1st grader liked the idea of the game and I loved the parent report section but the questions went from 2D shapes to multiplicstion and graphing in a matter of 4 minutes of play. I thought it was going to go in order of difficulty but that was a sure fire way to lose motivation. Sorry, app was deleted. Great idea but poor order of questions.', ""It's a good game as a whole, but the fact that you need a membership to merely evolve the pets is frustrating. after every fight it asks you to evolve them when you can't! It's aggravating because that can be implemented into the non-members' games without any issues and less complaints."", ""The worst educational app. It only wants your money, for an optional upgrade. The upgrade itself isnt educational, it only allows your character to get new outfits, hair, etc. Most of the items in the store need membership to buy it. The storyline doesn't make any sense. There is barely any updates for the game. The chat has limits on what you can type. It has the education in the game overal, just fix the mistakes and I'll give you 5 stars Prodigy."", ""It so fun! I used to hate the thought of math, so I failed. Then when our teacher introduced us to this I started to like math. This makes learning math fun. All the items you can earn, and the pets/companions you can earn. I especially love that your companions can evolve. My Rickrack is taking forever to evolve though. Sometimes I feel like it's not gonna evolve into the Flyger. Is there a reason for that?"", ""I played this on a computer at school with my class and it's OUTSTANDING! The story is amazing and I love catching so many different kinds of monsters! But to admit it, I don't like the new art style. Even though they have better animations, I kinda prefer the older art. I mean, what's a Trip Trop without a flute? SPOILER ALERT!!! I've played it for a year and I've finally got both the Ivorys (Trip Trop and Truckle) and recently, I got the Embershed!"", ""As a teacher, I have found Prodigy as a very useful tool in the classroom. First of all, the students love it. Unlike many academic programs, Prodigy continues to stimulate my student's interests throughout the whole school year.  Second, the ability to assign specific topics/standards at a student's level and access reports help teachers gain very useful data. Finally, the results seen in the students' understanding and enjoyment of math has been phenomenal."", 'Great and not. My kids have a lot of fun with this! However my sons game constantly crashes which is very frustrating so he has to start missions over. The reminder of not having a membership is crazy. No upgrading or evolving without it sadly. I would love to have a membership but it would be over a hundred bucks for my two kids. I thought there was a pay by month but they wanted it all upfront. Thats just not doable for us. Fix the crashing and constant not a member reminder and its great.', ""I love this game. It's fun and educational. The storyline is neat too! But I think you've gone a bit too far with the membership. It seems as if you need the membership to do almost ANYTHING. And I think it would be better as a one purchase the and NOT a trial. But I do have one question, are there ANY differences between downloading the game and just playing it in the internet? Kind of a waste of storage if you ask me. Other than the membership, the game is pretty good."", 'Ok, so I started playing back in 2017. And I could evolve pets, climb the tower, and the characters looked better. I came back in 2021 and I can\'t even evolve my pets anymore! The characters now look different than they did like 4 years ago, but some of my accessories now say ""Members Only"". I can\'t climb the tower anymore. And the game is just not fun anymore. When I spin the town wheel, I keep winning ""Member Only"" items. So I really don\'t want to play anymore.', ""pretty fun game and an interesting way to make math a bit less boring. i kind of wish there were more places where you could buy things with normal coins though. also, i got the keystones out of order and now Gale won't fix any of the other ones besides the firefly one. if you (the developers and game designers for this game) could fix those two things or at least the keystone one i might be willing to edit my review to 5 star because overall its a cool game:) good luck with math everyone!!"", 'I like it but every 5 minutes of playing it kicks me out when im trying to solve a problem. i give it 3 stars for nice graphics, and it has better stuff in it. the other two stars are for the membership thing and the kicking me out problem. I dont like it when you have to get membership for evolving your pet or getting buddies. i dont know if you can get a buddie but so far I seen the membership page and it shows the buddie thing. I hope someone reads this and fix the problem.', ""It used to be fun, but afterwards it just became plain and boring. First off, I loved evolving my pets and it was lots of hard work. When I was able to evolve my pet, I had to pay for stupid membership. Second, in chests I win awesome items. However, once the updates rolled in, I wasn't able to use as many as I was able to. I deleted this game. If we end up having to pay to play, it will just be a big rip off considering this game is perfect for math. Please make the game how it used to be."", ""I like the concept, but would like it if you could change the grade level. As the questions being asked are too much for my 5th grader at his chosen grade level. So it would be nice if he could go back and choose the next level down without having to reregister with a whole new email address. Make it an option and I'd be more than happy to give more stars."", ""The game is absolutely amazing! But the fact that you need membership for every little thing is annoying. Evolving up a pet? Membership! Climbing the dark tower? Membership! Its annoying, but I hope that the end of the game doesn't need membership. I'm currently level 61. And almost done with the game."", 'I love this game. It turns learning math to a whole different level with challenges and many more things. I am a member and it has changed the way I look at math. There is one thing though. I would love it if you could add a food shop. I ask this because when I need food it some times takes about a month to get one piece. I was just wondering if you could add it to prodigy. Maybe in lamplight town like the potion shop. But all in all this game is amazing.', ""I got to level 100! Now I'm super op. But there's ONE tiny little problem, it's all the things you want to have, but they all cost......you guessed it..MEMBERSHIP!! I had membership not long ago, for probably a year, everything was so different and now if you want to equip and item, MEMBERSHIIIPPP. If you want to get a different chest, MEMBERSHIPP. I mean, it's the way you make money. I wish there was a way where you don't get membership pop-ups"", ""It's a fun game where u learn in a fun way and you can meet other people and walk around unlike MOST math games.The only bad thing is that you have to battle monsters (for quests) every 10 seconds which is kinda annoying. It's a cool game because you can also customize your character with money in game.You should add a option so you can run away from monsters.I mean it's annoying that you need membership for a lot of things,but you can evolve your pets for free when they reach level 60."", ""Game used to be fun and educational, now it's about arrogant game devs making money. To do almost anything fun, you have to do a math problem, which gets annoying. You have to buy an expensive membership to progress very much. There's a balance you have to reach between math, and just having fun, for it to be a math game, in my opinion this has way too much math, they may as well take out the game portions of it, and call it a free math test. The game is also really stupid and pointless."", ""I love prodigy, but one of my biggest pet peeves is how the membership works. Price: Memberships do not need to be so expensive. Period. Member stars/boxes, the dab, clouds, and special houses: These are almost entirely useless and I don't care what you do with them. Member stars and boxes just shouldn't exist at all. Things everyone should have: 1st: EVOLUTION. I have been playing prodigy for 4 years and have never gotten a Frostfang. This is infuriating because I have a high level Articlaw, plenty of money, and have most definitely seen a Frostfang before (It was in a battle with a member). If you change anything, Please let non-members evolve their pets! This is important! 2nd: Member-only purchases. Besides evolution, this is one of the best features at driving me up a wall. 3rd: Medium and large houses. I mean really, you save up for a decently-sized house and then you can't buy it because you're not a member. Something else: When you buy a pet, it should be the same level as you or at least the monsters you fight. Whenever I buy a pet, it starts at level 1. I have been saving up for the 2,000 shiver Frostfang since shivers existed, and would appreciate it if you fix this soon. PS: I am 10 years old, for 4 of these years I have played Prodigy and loved it. I would very much appreciate it if you at least consider these notes and reply."", ""This game is amazing! Yes it does constantly ask for membership and yes it does cost money but that's because it needs money to be able to program the game to a higher advantage. It's fun for my class. As a math teacher, I highly recommend this game for the kids. It's a mission game but it teaches kids math. It has them work out the problems and makes sure they're not cheating. My class loves the game and I've seen a lot of improvement in the grades. Prodigy is our school's #1."", 'Prodigy is such a great game to support students in mathematics! As a third grade teacher, I use it every day to provide practice, review, and enrichment to my students. It is so easy to differentiate the assigned material to each student! I also make sure all of my friends with kids get them on the game, especially during summer!', 'I dont have this app on my tablet because it runs the battary down. But I have it on my computer and it works very well, I also use this in school. But the only conplates I have that sometimes it freezes and then I long out and then back in and it loses all my progress in that battle or what ever world im playing in. (which is really annoying.) But if your looking for a fun game to play and you also want to boost your smarts or grades well then I highly recomend this app to you!', 'This is a great game and my kids both love it, however they are frustrated by the insane amount of in-game advertising and the fact that quite a bit of game content is locked behind paid membership. I love the learning algorithm the game runs on, and it is effective. However, it is painful to watch my kids being frustrated that they cannot collect all the pets or evolve the pets they have. I would have gladly given 5 stars if membership was cosmetic and not actual game content.', 'Even though the game is fun to play, it has some problems that me really frustrated, for instance, if i leave my phone turned off, part of the screen would be white, and when im in a battle, sometimes the game would freeze and you Cant fix it!!! The super fun but these problems make my experience really bad', ""There is a very big problem with this RPG it's the fact that one of the best features of RPGs is evolution where one of your characters becomes so strong that when a level up happens it changes size and form well staying around it's original form to keep that power controlled. sound cool well sorry but you have to become a member for that to happen which all so means you have to pay for this features that literally every other RPG has for free making it a total rip off for it. Now I get the the customizations and all that you have to pay for but this one, come one seriously? And its not like it's hard to get into the no pay zone it was there a few years ago so it's not that hard (really it's probably pretty easy)so please make it a feature everyone can have.please.""]",False,"['com.abcya.android.games', 'com.Sumdog.App3D', 'com.teachyourmonstertoread.tmapp', 'air.com.starfall.more', 'com.classdojo.android']",com.prodigygame.prodigy,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.prodigygame.prodigy&hl=en&gl=us,['com.prodigygame.parent']

The scoring is also terrible,it also makes the students have to reach the goal score of 100% which wastes time that could be used on other assignments.( The scoring also decreases if you get an answer incorrect) An assignment that would take 5-10 minutes to do takes almost an hour to finish. Though this may be easy for the teachers during quarantine,it is hard for the students because,they aren't able to finish all assignments"", 'This app is VERY frustrating. It takes you down by 10 points when you miss one question then it takes forever to earn the points back. I don\'t know why schools use this app. It makes me dread math class. And the drawing tool is very in-accurate. I made a ""6"" then it went to a ""q."" And they make the questions in the ""challange zone"" way too difficult. It was not a good experience for me and it doesn\'t work as promised. I definately would not reccomend this app. I would give it 0 stars if I could.', 'Not a terrible app, but could be better. As a student, my one complaint is the point system. It can take hours to get to 100 and if you get one question wrong it will drop significantly. Although this is extremely frustrating and annoying, it is an overall good learning app, it has a nice description and explanation as to why you get something wrong if you do, and there are even rewards.', ""I think the intentions are good and it's more of a practice app then trying to learn. But I think it is ridiculous on the amount of points it takes off because you get it wrong especially in the challenge zone. You only go up 1 point and lose about 10 to 15 if its wrong. It also kind of discourages kids like myself, and they can just give up without finishing and it shouldn't feel like that. I know someone that once threw their phone out of frustration and cracked their phone."", ""IXL Overall isn't a very good design First of all, at the begining it adds 10 points for getting a question right. Great so you think its adding 10 for each one then you realize when your higher up it only adds TWO. In other words, It misleads you to believe it gives you many points, but really doesn't. Second of all, when you get a question wrong it subtracts about 3x the amount for getting a question. (Which is EXTREMLY frustrating) Third of all, ITS ONLY FOR PRACTICING! It doesn't teach."", ""I can't really say much about the actual math and learning stuff about this app. My problem is with the point system. You earn 1 or 2 points every time you get a question correct, but lose about 10-20 points when you get one wrong. It's extremely frustrating and stressful to have to keep redoing everything because of a few small mistakes and the amount of times I've cried while doing this is embarrassing, so having a little kid doing this probably isn't a good idea."", ""IXL isn't a good app. There is a point system for most of the skill (lessons) and it's garbage. If you don't know the answer and pick the wrong one you lose points and it shows how to complete the question but most of the time you'll just skip it. You have to get 100 points in total to complete a skill. When you get up to 90 you get 1 point per right answer. It also looks visually bad. When you get on the website it doesn't look fun it looks boring. Parents pick any other app than this one."", ""It's the WORST. It's easy too use but that's not my problem, I'm writing this because each time I'm doing so well I can just restart all over again because of one MISTAKE. The explanations barely make any sense and they are extremely confusing. It's way too hard and we barely get any chances to fix our mistake, I could be all the way at 99 then I got one wrong and I'm already back to 80. Also I dislike how it gets harder and harder each question. If I could I would rate this 0 stars."", 'Worst app in the world! It causes me stress and anxiety. It is no help when trying to learn new topics. Its ""smartscore"" goes up about 2-4 points and when you get a question wrong it goes down 10! Don\'t waste your time its not worth it. If i could give this a negative-star rating i would. If there was ANY chance of me giving it another star you would have to fix the smartscore, and give it better instructions on how to do a problem.', ""Over all bad experience, it doesn't round up the number of questions so if u do, for example 27 & get 3 wrong it's 88% as apposed to the 90% it would have been if u had just done 30 & u also did 7 extra questions, it time shames u, & it sets u back if u get one wrong and it seems to increase the amount it sets u back the more u get wrong, this incentivizes people to cheat & save time if they ever want to finish an assignment. I will say tho it saves your place, shows what you got wrong & no ads."", 'This app is only the most discouraging app out there and if anything it makes me want to avoid my work instead of doing it. You answer a question wrong and it takes off way more points that it gives you. It does not explain the questions with detail when you get them wrong. And the drawing feature on tablets makes it very difficult to write exponents. It works well but it is far from enjoyable.', 'Very frustrating app for children to use. They have a system of points going up or down during the practice. They need 100 to complete de practice. So it can take 1 hour plus to complete one practice because as soon as they make one mistake they loose points and start back from a lower level of points. So basically the child gets so frustrated that he looses focus and stamina to reach 100. Very very frustrating app.', ""The app is not very good. You can't use skill plans or check on the progress of your child. It doesn't show recommendations on what they should be working on. We use IXL everyday and I was excited to have the app so we could use it while we were running around this summer and still get our practice in. The kids complain that it not easy to navigate and would rather do it at home."", ""Why this application will never be viable is because you get discouraged from getting questions wrong, like you are supposed to be perfect. You do about two questions right, and it gets you at least three points up, and you get one wrong and go back at least five, at most ten. It's really horrible to motivate, encourage, or even raise someone's score. I spend way too long having to do tedious work, and the longer students work the more anxious or annoyed they get which makes mistakes easier."", ""This app is extremely annoying. The point system is overwhelming infuriating due to the ratio between points earned and points lost. This lousy excuse for a point system leaves children struggling to reach the goal set for them by their teacher. No child wishes to spend hours using an education tool that is so poorly designed. Unfortunately, I am unable to give zero stars, but I definitely would. This app's frustrations could be easily solved if the developers were to simply listen to feedback."", 'I hate this. Have been using this app for a while and has been great up until now. I was doing my lessons as usual and spent nearly 3 hours on them, once I\'m nearly done it freezes and crashes, everything gone. I get the lose point system to make sure you can\'t randomly guess, but all it does is make me angry to unimaginable extent. I\'m on the verge of tears right now. Also, the ""help"" isn\'t that great. It gives you a nice way to do it but all it does is give you the equation, The bare minimum.', 'I do not recommend to anyone, if anything I recommend Khan Academy. I have used this for 3 years, it causes incredible stress to myself and other students. They bump you down more than they bump you up when you get something wrong, which makes you have to work 2 or 3 times as hard to get back up. They expect you to go with one example and fly, and you cannot look at the example if you complete the first question already. They do not offer any help after the first problem.', ""Horrible app. Totally unusable! Crashes all the time. If it's frustrating for the parents, I can only imagine how frustrating it is for my kids or kids in general trying to learn. I thought it was the tablet I was using but the issue remains the same regardless of device. Definitely stop promoting this app because it makes me just want to cancel my membership. Horrible!! Do not download at all. Keep your sanity.. do not download.. it's that bad. Did I mention...Horrible?"", ""This app gives me nightmares, the second I hear it being a assignment my heart stops. The smart score system is so stupid. I would spend about an hour to get to a 90, then get 1 question wrong and get sent back to a 82. The idea is great but it's so time consuming. When I miss type a answer or anything around that I get it wrong. This app has left me so many nights crying at how frustrating it is."", ""I've had a terrible experience with this app. The smartscore system is bad, and if you are stuck on a question and keep getting it wrong, your smart score decreases and you have to make your way back up there. And if you try to get help from the examples included, you can't, because you can only use the examples at the start of the lesson. This app is excruciatingly painful to sit through each day, and I wish that it could be improved."", ""This app is not bad, but it can be pretty frustrating. You have something called a Smartscore and teachers just grade you of the amount of SmartScore you have in a task. To master a task, you need to get to 100 points. You can lose Smartscore points by getting a question wrong, and most of us remember that time when we were at 99 of SmartScore but we got a question wrong and went back to 88 😑 overall the app is not bad for practice. For 1-star reviewers, don't be so exaggerate please."", ""The point system is harsh. You get one wrong, -20. You get one right, +1. You go up by a single point but go down by twenty. I'm a student, I'm not doing the google classroom thing, but I seriously think the point system need some adjustments, and some of the answers for the science questions (the rest to me are fine) are really confusing. The make no sense to me, and I end up just memorizing the question and answer so that when it appears again, I know that answer, even if I dont understand it."", ""Okay I have a serious bone to pick with this app as a student. I only installed it to write this review. My school has used countless different learning platforms and we hated most of them. Somehow this stupid one managed to be worse than ALECKS and Kahn Academy combined. It doesn't feel rewarding. It doesn't reach me anything, it makes me want to break something, it is like torture. I would rather just do a stupid paper over the subject because the point system is probably the worst part."", ""It's the worst app ever, I would rate it 0 stars, if you mess up once, you have to either restart or just loose lots of freaking points. I don't know what to say honestly my teacher makes us get on it every day, It's VERY frustrating and annoying to deal with, It's the worst school app ever, I don't get why some people like it."", ""I would give it 0 stars if it was an option, don't waste your time downloading this, There's not much interaction to it and makes it seem even more boring. I EVEN WENT TO 96 TO A 88. It will keep sending you down until you get it right and it's RIDICULOUS HONESTLY. It will make the child even more stressed out because any time u get ONE question wrong it sends you back down, I don't suggest this for kids. Espically if your child or you have a weak subject, it just makes it seem more stressful."", ""As a Geometry Student who has to use IXL, its awful. You have to painstakingly go up and up point into your mastery, then, once you make a single slip up: you have to start over. You had 94 points, yes, sure, but now? Now you are back at 73, you have to completely start back, and its a neverending cycle. Maybe the app wouldn't be so bad if the questions counted more to you and less away when you got them wrong. Or if they had equal value (+5 for correct, -5 when incorrect) so it would balance."", 'I really dislike IXL in general. I\'m about to go into High School(I was held back a year), and I have to do homeschooling. My Mama got this for me and my little sister so we could do homeschooling, but it\'s just not right. My little sister finds it great, and can learn with it easy, but I\'m more of a ""I need to be shown physically"" kind of learner. When I did public school, we used this a lot. After we learned the lesson, we\'d use them as review. I wish there was more to it than just, well, that', 'All it does is give you a problem you have never seen before and you have to solve it. The ""help"" you get makes no sense and it teaches you nothing but how to guess when your frustrated. Worst part is every class used it because it was required by the principal even when students AND TEACHERS complained! I would absolutely give a 0/5 if possible. Please do not download this nor use it in your classroom! The child\'s mental health will thank you.', ""Why does this app have to be so horrible? It is required in our math and la classes. We have nearly 25 every week (in total) and you never seem to be able to finish! You'll be able to go up 5 then if wrong go down by like 15! It is horrible, everyone in our school hates it! And it is not because I don't like learning, it's boring, tedious, and I just learned that I have spent a WEEK of my life that I'll never get back on IXL. THAT IS CRAZY!"", 'This app ruined my life, the moment I downloaded it,I new something was wrong with me. I tried using it, but every time I turned it on, something bad happens. My cousin resently broke his arm. I was with him when it happened. I had just showed him the app and then all the sudden he got up and ran out of our house and into the busy road. Maybe this is just a coinsedence, but I also just want to say how bad this app is in general, everything about is sucks. Nobody download it. Please!!!!!!!!!', ""I think this app is good but it doesn't teach you how to solve the problem and the example is not explaining it well. Like 3 or 4 times it took me 2 or 3 days to finsh one lesson and my teacher wants me to solve questions properly not just answer it. I like prodigy better and the maker do u bother even to make it better"", ""It's OK but does not include everything from the website. I pay for the membership and as for the site I love it but the app is severely lacking. If they would update it to include the games and all the extra features the website has it would be 5 stars easy."", ""This app is great for practice and helps children such as myself learn, it is not hard if you know the skill. There is a major flaw though. If you get a promble wong it drops you down like 8 points. I you are someone who doesn't give up and works hard to the end, I suggest this for you. But if getting frustrated easily is you. And it keeps you from learning just keep your cool and dont use this app."", ""I can't get my child logged in. Can't get registered as a user. I'm using the same log in info that gets me logged into the website, but it doesn't transfer to the app. Completely pointless if it can't be used. Also can't reset anything since it all goes through the school."", 'The best app ever!!!! We tried 4 apps before that over couple months, but once we started using IXL after I learned from a family friend who is a teacher and they use IXL for students at their school, It is the best for many reasons: 1- It is designed to teach and train your child and no child should have a problem progressing 2- It is very easy to use 3- It shows y I wonderful award ribbon once you complete a lesson. 4- built systematically including all aspects of reading and writing', ""I really can't stand this app... parents, teachers, and really anybody, just please don't stress people and students with this app. It takes long hours of a person's life, it is very stressful, and there is nothing that makes it fun for anyone... Just Don't 😓"", ""Literally the worst app ever. don't recommend. It's very stressful and it drops you down more than it bumps you up and it's practically impossible to learn anything"", ""One of the worst apps you can ever experience using as a child these days. Now teachers out here posting assignments like we going to do it with no issues while struggling 24/7 to get even 1 question correct. Even deltamath gives a better experience than this trash app Deltamath gives very helpful examples that improves you alot while ixl does the opposite. I'm in 9th grade doing 10th grade work and not being teached none of the things I'm doing right now. I hope the folders suffer the same."", 'Don\'t like it. I give it a 2 star because its an actual good app for learning, and all 1 stars are angry students (like me.) But it makes no sense how if u get one wrong it brings u down like 6, but when u get one right, it gives u like 2 or 3. And the science ones. I CANNOT WITH THEM. Pleade just make this more ""enjoyable"" for students', 'Horrible, the way you lose points is terrible! You should keep showing them how to do it! But it shouldnt make you go back because you know what you did wrong! Also, you should make it more fun, or else we\'ll always forget any thing you ""Teach"" us. If your a teacher, your if these promlems arent fixed, please dont give it to your students!

This is frustrating, especially when even an adult can't hear it and then she spells it wrong WITH help! Often the beginning or ending consonant is so soft that it cannot be heard at all, even with the volume up to maximum. The volume level also fluctuates a bit from activity to activity. We have been using this for a few weeks and have seen progress already. Will keep using, but hope the pronunciation improves."", ""My daughter loves reading eggs, math seeds and fast phonics. Reading eggs has helped her immensely to learn to read and with the addition of fast phonics, it has helped her to improve her pronunciation. The biggest problem I have is with the app itself. After she completes a lesson it sometimes freezes, especially in reading eggs. The only way I've found to fix it is by shutting down the app and restarting it which is frustrating when my daughter is in the middle of something and has to start over. Some of the lessons are a bit repetitive but she hasn't seemed to mind. If the developer could fix the issue with the app freezing up then you would get 5 stars from me."", ""Although I thought the educational content of this game was great, it requires too much manual dexterity. This, not the instruction, was the source of my child's frustration. Many of the interaction points were extremely small. A lot of the time, this was clearly an intentional design choice. There was a ton of blank space on the screen, so the designers could have easily made buttons larger. Maybe this game is okay on s tablet, but it is unusable for a small child on a phone."", ""I have only experienced a few times when it freezes or doesn't keep a child's records of what they have done. The worst part is actually being told they are willing to help by phone... they don't answer and can't leave a message. Live chat... no one is ever there. Or e-mail... which problems can not be fixed by. It is disappointing when you really think highly of an app (with the freezes and all) but have poor experience with customer service."", ""It's a great learning app BUT it constantly crashes and is super slow to load between each activity. My son and I get frustrated with the strikes out when getting things wrong. Ex. Picking the letter on the board. Three strikes for the double activity. He gets through the first with maybe a strike because he accidentally hit the wrong letter. On to the second part, gets one wrong or accidentally bumps wrong letter....you have to start the WHOLE activity over. He gets frustrated and quits."", ""Okay So the app is excellent for learning, but the app consistently freezes and closes at any giving time, also the new feature Fast Phonics doesn't work it keeps freezing my daughter only got to level two with no luck in moving pass because it keeps freezing. I would rate the app 5+ if the app worked properly, please fix this issue so our children can learn without interruptions thanks! Other then those issues my daughter loves learning loves this app highly recommend it!"", 'My kids love this app! The program has helped my daughter profoundly with her reading. The way it is set up works great for kids who need interactive game style learning. I do get some resistance with the games that are more repetitive. Also, I do experience glitches occasionally where it freezes, sticks on a certain scene (the congrats screen or a game) or just loads & loads & loads.', 'My kids love the math seeds! My 6 yr old struggled in math. When we started this he wanted nothing to do with it. He was frustrated. But once he got started, he realized how easy it was to navigate and that he was progressing and understood it. I 100% recommend this app. We also love the reading and phonics! It makes learning fun!!!', 'I had to change my review. This is a fantastic app. Please try it. My son has learned a lot of math with it. The reading eggs are good. The storylines are great. I wish the 7-13 reading comprehension portion was better. But it is definitely worth for pre K to 2nd grade. After that the stories get a little boring and the graphics need work. I would definitely recommend for new readers. The mathseeds is my favorite. They really asses the child and he can make his own progress.', ""One can see a lot of work has gone into this app. People who know properly how to teach reading developed the concept. My daughter really enjoys collecting the eggs by doing the exercises, which are funny and divers. I can also see that her reading has improved. What I don't like are all the distractions within the app. Yes, some games and fun in between are fine. But I think a bit less of this would have been better."", ""Highly recommended! Living in a non-English speaking country and struggling with sending the kids to after school English lessons, ReadingEggs is a lifesaver. All my kids love it - (ages 5-9). It's a fantastic program and at every turn keeps on surprising with new features. Only confusion was we thought in the beginning that it had to be an app on an android/ios device and we weren't that thrilled about it but turned out that it doesn't have to be! We find it much much easier to use on PC and we love it!"", ""I really like the content of this app and it holds my 3 year old's attention for a long time. She learns lots from it as evidenced by her reading outside the app. It is quite buggy though with frequent crashes and glitches and impossible to get through to support. I also think I places it is too sensitive. We work through lessons together but often, especially with the books, if you touch the screen by mistake to point to a letter it registers a wrong answer or it flips the page. Annoying."", ""This is a great app. The activities are diverse and based on strong literacy learning principles. My 5-year-old loves it, and he recognizes that it is helping him learn. It also helps him control impulses as he has to listen or think before clicking (well, he's working on it).We have to close it and restart it a lot. I still really recommend it. Update - had to remove two stars because of glitches that make it difficult to use. Curriculum is great, program has problems."", ""I would give it 5 stars if it didn't keep freezing and crashing all the time! My son is 2 and I decided to introduce him to an app to stimulate his mind. He always asks to play on it but it always freezes and gets stuck on the loading screen and I have to keep logging out and back in again. I'm only on the free trial at the minute so won't be paying for it if its going to keep freezing and crashing all the time."", ""Really like the idea of this app but it is unusable in it's current form with the constant freezing so we will not be subscribing. Hopefully the developers are addressing the issues as the actual program is great, just doesn't work technically. Have checked tech specs and we are way above minimum requirements, there are definitely bugs in the software."", 'Great app but freezes alot which is frustrating for my 7 year old daughter. The app freezes so we have to keep closing the app to move into the next lesson. My daughter loses interest as it happens a few times during her Reading Eggs sessions. If the issue is sorted, it would be incredible, she would be able to focus and concentrate more on her lessons. Otherwise a great app for learning.', ""My almost 4 year old begs to use this every day. He has come on leaps and bounds, he genuinely enjoys the challenges and gets so excited when it's time for a new egg to hatch, a quiz, a new certificate. Our only issue is that some of the cut scenes freeze his tablet and we have to close and re-enter the app to carry on, it only adds maybe 20 seconds when it happens but it's a nuisance. But that may be down to the tablet rather than the app. Overall, a firm favourite that I'm happy to pay for!"", ""The game is a fabulous program of reading and math. But the free version is full of bugs, constantly freezes itself and my phone. Very frustrating for my 4 year old and me! That's why 2 stars. UPDATE : I got a free trial option so reinstalled it. I click play on FAST PHONICS, choose the level, then a blue screen appears and doesnt go away. I have to shut the game and restart. My tech specs are fine. I was considering buying the mthly subscription but am hesitant now."", ""Signed up originally for the 30 day free trial. It is a good tool, albeit a little too repetitive. However as the many other reviews have also said, it constantly freezes! You have to shut it down and reopen and hope you haven't lost your level progress!! We have access on several up-to-date devices with stable internet connection and the issue continues. For the premium subscription I'd expect better to be honest. Will be cancelling at the end of the free trial unfortunately due to this."", ""Some of the content is great, if you can get to it. The navigation is awful - it's unclear what all the different categories represent, and everything takes AGES to load. Also, every time we try to get to the lessons my daughter has to retake the placement test. We've tried the same test three times this week, and it's very long and INCREDIBLY boring. Presumably this is a bug, but there's about 30 questions, and they're way beyond a six year old's capability - it's upsetting for her"", ""I would love to give a higher rating however the constant freezing is ridiculous. I've contacted support but instead of admitting the app has issues they told me the tablet probably didn't meet specifications. I had confirmed that it was well within all specifications before even contacting support. The program is wonderful but we have barely been able to use it recently. We have the most recent update yet it still froze 6 times in 10 minutes. Please do something about this."", ""It's a great app and my kids are showing some good learning developments. One little annoying thing though : volume level fluctuates a lot. i.e. lessons start with low voice and go up suddenly. First 10-20 seconds of the lessons are usually quieter. This need a constant controlling of the device volume. Would be great if you could fix it"", ""Reading eggs is a great program and is working well for my daughter but the app has a few problems. The volume is inconsistent so you have to adjust it frequently. The app lags in some activities and freezes at the end of others so you have to restart it a few times each lesson. I'm hoping these issues will be fixed."", 'The program itself is great and my 6 year old and 3 year old both love it. I am currently on the trail version and think we will be doing the monthly subscription, however the app constantly freezes, showing a big black screen while the audio continues. Our device meets the specifications so I have no clue why this happens. Both on the app and the website (yes, while using the latest version of chrome). Please fix ASAP. I also think the app title should have mathseeds in it.', ""Both my 5 year old and my 6 year old love Maths Seeds, Fast Phonics and Reading Eggs. Some of the games can drag on a bit and these lose interest (I realise the importance of repetition but sometimes it's a fine line between that and boredom) but, for the most part, this is an excellent resource. Definitely the best one we've tried and we've subscribed for another year without hesitation."", ""The app itself is fantastic and I can't recommed it enough to help phonic and reading development. My little one really struggled until we signed up and since then, has complete soared through and doesnt grimmace at the sight of words. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because of the constant freezing and crashing recently, which has started to put my little one off using it."", ""Great when it works, but as more people seem to be finding, it just doesn't work very well once you get out of Reading Eggs Junior. It's a technically undemanding app, but crashes and hangs all the time. As a piece of advice re customer service, perhaps take some time to look at your coding instead of blaming the power of people's devices (of which ours meets the requirements). There are problems with the app, take that onboard before it really starts to impact your business."", ""The interface is terrible. The games frequently don't work with touch screen or a mouse. My kids are constantly frustrated because they get 'wrong answers' when the game is actually malfunctioning. The parent dashboard disappears ALL THE TIME so I can't access the free printables to which I am supposed to have access. And customer service simply never responds to my queries about these issues. Don't waste your time or money on this program."", ""My child literally LOVES Reading Eggs. She was looking for something to get her reading / spelling skills up, so I looked into this. Me, being a responsible parent, downloaded it for her to try for some days. She enjoyed it, so I started to pay the $15 each month. Her favourite part is learning, and MY favourite part is.. THERE'S NO ADS! No distractions from my child learning. Great app, keep it up."", ""Educationally good but poor user interface at times and too easy for kids to fail at a game. On most games there is a '3 or 5 strikes and out' rule which means that my child will never finish the game without having to start again as the pin point accuracy required is too great. On some games the instructions talk over each other and you can't work out what is required of you. As an adult it's playable but not for younger kids. If it weren't for these issues I would gladly subscribe."", 'Absolutely brilliant program. I saw my daughter at the age of 4, reading better than kids that are 7 or 8. Thanks to reading eggs, right before my eyes. Amazing. Worth every cent. It\'s almost bad parenting, i.e. You don\'t have to do anything, and your child learns to read. It\'s amazing. We started maths seeds now, and by default she is powering through the lessons. When your kid yells out for your phone because she ""wants to do learning!"" (in her exact words), what more can you do but give?', 'As a mother of a 5 year old and a 3 year old, and as an English teacher, I cannot recommend this app highly enough. We have steered clear of apps and tablets for our girls, however when I discovered this app, and after a successful free trial, we allow both of them set time with supervision, and both are excelling in their literacy skills. Our 3 year old is sounding out, blending, knowing words by sight (rapidly catching up with her sister who is in school), and both girls really enjoy the app.', ""It's a good app, however I'm experiencing the same issues that another reviewer has mentioned. The app crashes a lot, and freezes on between learning activities. Some times you can here the audio instruction playing but the screen has not moved on the the correct page. It freezes at the end of certain tasks. It is not my device or internet connection that is causing this. I have to go to setting and close the app every time it cracked and restart the app."", ""I found the app is missing allot of vital stuff. My number one is when the child gets something wrong you just play a sound , so it doesn't show what they did wrong instead of 'if the child has to choose mmm and they choose the letter c you need to play the phonics so they know the difference instead of a sound. If that makes sense, it just small buts that makes a whole lot of difference and turns a mistake into a sort of subliminal learning."", ""I have this app on a laptop and 2 tablets for my children to use at home during lockdown. I've lost track of the amount of times the app has frozen and booted them back to the home page, forcing them to start all over again. This has caused lots of tears because one of my children is not good at English and really struggles to get through each task."", ""This has been excellent for my son who I'm home-schooling. Loads to do on there and I love the progress report and emails on what he has achieved and what he needs work with. Also the print off bonus material is so helpful. It does take some time to get the hang but worth it!"", ""Daughters really love this and always want to go on it which is great as they are learning so many reading skills without knowing! :) But there are a few letter sounds pronounced incorrect which isnt helpful i.e they pronounce the P grapheme 'puh'. Also my youngest cant do it by herself yet as you can only get three goes wrong before having to start again. It would be good if there was an easier setting for her (she's 3). Another thing we find is the books are read out by the man way too fast!"", ""The site is cumbersome, uninspired and the graphics are BORING! (This is coming from a person that misses the old atari games - I'm not fussy with graphics lol) We had to skip exercises because it was difficult to navigate and the volume was either woeful or blasting None of my 3 kids learned to read from it, they enjoyed it mostly but I bought it to teach them, not as a game. The site needs to be updated instead of milked for profit. There are far better programs out there"", 'Not great for struggling readers. 1st the background music makes it hard to hear the words the app reads to the child and there is no way to turn the music off. 2nd there are animated pet things that blow raspberries at the child when they get something wrong. Not very encouraging to a kid that is already sensitive about being behind.', 'EGG-CELLENT My 4 year old absolutely loves reading eggs, it has made my daughters learning to read easy and fun! She has loved interacting with the phonics\u202fgames, and recieveing motivating rewards, which helps her stay on track\u202fwith her learning. I asked my daughter what she loves most about Reading Eggs and she said ""memory game, sounds button and the science videos. Can we do a science experiment now, mummy?"" She plays on this atleast 15 minuets a day and she has improved so much.']",False,"['com.learnwithhomer.webapp', 'air.com.starfall.more', 'org.khankids.android', 'com.learninga_z.onyourown', 'mobi.abcmouse.academy_goo']",com.blake.readingeggs.android,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blake.readingeggs.android&hl=en&gl=us,"['air.com.thirdsense.eggy100', 'air.com.thirdsense.eggyWords250phone']"

","With this release, we&#39;ve fixed some critical bugs and enhanced the app&#39;s stability for improved performance.<br>As always, more changes are on the way, and we thank you for your support and patience!<br>","[""I love Ted talks BUT this app is killing my experience. It won't even let me watch a video, it Takes a long time to even start to search. I am constantly restarting the app so that I can even click the search button. I finally got it to click a video and it freezes on the play video screen and im unable to actually play the video. I will be switching back to the website until the app is fixed."", ""It wasn't the best app before, just a general app experience with quality content. Now, I can't even start a video, the entire thing just freezes. At one point, to see if it was just the page or a loading issue, I flipped through all the bottom options, account, listen, search, home, only to have it lock and only allow me to scroll the loaded videos. Not play them, just look. I have a healthy S20 5g, no issues with the phone or service, just a junker of an app."", ""The talks are good but the app itself is slow and a bit buggy the player opens when I change the volume or it doesn't open at all I tap on the screen and nothing happens it doesn't close the app when I'm tapping the back button it really sucks. If you don't mind the bugs this app is good for watching these talks offline but the podcasts are best on Google podcasts."", ""This is not the Ted I used to know. What is with a 20-minute ads that are hard to skip? If you tried to listen to a playlist, it inserts ads that are 20 minutes long and then you have to click a button to skip. So unattended listening is dead. Sometimes it just skips the next video and starts at 20 minute add again. I don't mind short ads give it up to a minute and a half long. Thats fine. But 20 minutes long???"", ""I really want to love this app but the download feature is AWFUL. It constantly fails to download playlists and will try for hours. And then, if you try to cancel it downloading a playlist because it is stuck it will undownload the WHOLE playlist. On top of that, even once you manage to get something downloaded, unless you're connected to WiFi or data it frequently won't play it. And sometimes even when you're connected it still won't play it and will freeze and spin forever even if you kill the app. Andddd furthermore, I couldn't find the setting that only allows it to stream over wifi. There's one for downloading only over wifi. But I've accidentally streamed over my data plan multiple times now. Which I wish I had more control over. Overall, the only reason I didn't give this app 1 star is because the content is worthwhile and the interface would be great if I could get the downloading to work smoothly. As it is, I feel like it's trash."", ""When full-screen, the pause button doesn't show up. It forces you to hit your own phone's back button if you want to pause, meanwhile the video is still playing as it minimizes the whole video. You have to press on the play bar to get the video up again, and only then the pause button is available. Aside from that, other streaming services allows you to customize subtitle size, but you can't on here, which is too big for the videos. I do appreciate the double language subtitles feature though."", ""The content and personalization features are great but any interaction with a video that is in progress causes the app to crash. if you try to rewind, change to portarit mode, skip ahead...video will stop playing. If it only occurred a few times there'd be no problem. But it happens every time. So if you're halfway through a video and it crashes you can restart it, but you cant skip ahead to the spot you were on last. Honestly I use the app to find great recommendations then find them on youtube"", 'This app is very buggy. If you do anything besides watch the selected video straight through (e.g. 15s rewind, change the playback speed, rotate the screen back to portrait mode, etc) you run a high risk of it completely crashing on you and having to wait to get the error message pop up asking if you want to force close it.', ""Ads are agressive and evil. I tried several times to watch one video kept having to see the same ad over and over and over. It wouldn't play the video at all. When I was able to watch another and immediate aggressive ad came on as soon as the talk finished. I understand needing to generate revenue but like many other apps using the app itself has become a very draining and negative experience due to aggressive ads"", ""The app has a glitch; when the next video plays, an add pops up, then it skips the video again and we have to re watch the add and it keeps replaying and skipping the next video. You have to get out of watching the next one and pick a different video, but sometimes the videos don't play and it gets stuck in thst cycle again... Just FYI if the developers didn't know. ..."", ""The podcasts are my favorite. WorkLife and Sincerely X are masterpieces that I am grateful to have had access to, and I sincerely wish there were more episodes to listen to! The only hitch is that sometimes the very end of the recordings are cut off :( it's just the final few seconds, but it leaves me curious! And I will continue to listen."", ""Love the ability to watch TED talks on the go but the UI/UX for a tech inspired ap is startingly terrible. It tends to freeze, no visual to indicate prior views, the auto play doesn't play the next video on the playlist, no ability to form your own playlists, no recommended videos and none of the surprise me options available on the Roku ap- it needs a major update in my opinion"", 'Seriously needs an update. I download videos via wifi for offline viewing and then when i go to watch them they need to use data to play. Also the ""clear downloads"" option is not working, my downloads are still there. Overall it\'s just glitchy. I love the talks and the options the app has but it just doesn\'t work quite right.', 'Love TED talks but the app is very beta on the tab S7+. Player; once in, does not let you switch app and come back and watch. Audio keeps running but video will not restore. Video controls are gone as soon as the video starts and wont come back, wont let you fast forward or rewind etc. I use the website now due to this app being so unusable and so beta feeling with these kind of amature bugs.', ""There are tons of very useful and inspiring Ted talks. And that is a great job done by speakers. But Ted apps developers' job is awful and disgusting. It takes only few seconds or taps to make the app not responding on Poco X3 Pro. And it doesn't matter whether the cache is emptied or not. The app just can't be used in its current state. Hope to see future updates very soon that will fix the app, otherwise I'll have to delete and forget about it, which I don't want at all."", ""The new version is terrible! I used to watch video a lot, but after updating . . . There's problems with loading and downloading videos and also you need to turn on the subtitle and set the language for every videos while you have set it in Setting Option. AND turning on the subtitle is not possible without maximizing screen!!!!"", 'I love TED videos, indeed. I loved the option that videos could be slow down, to understand a quick speed talker. I loved the feature that I could download ONLY the audio part. When two people talk to each other, there is no reason to watch them. But all these positiv elements are GONE. What has left, is a very slow, clumsy app - which I have just deleted!', ""I used to watch videos a lot on TED, but after I updated(I don't know which version was, but that version with white and red icon was perfect) I see so many bugs. Speed of loading is so down, appearance and new upgrades aren't satisfying at all. It's really hard to work with this new version. Besides all of those, so many videos aren't loading and become so annoying. This app is really helpful n I love it but this version is disappointing."", ""The updated app is literally useless. When scrolling/ sliding the videos they fly past too quickly. Then when you click on a video it doesn't do anything. Clicking on the bottom navigation links don't work either. It's been like this a long time I can't believe it hasn't been fixed by now."", ""Still same. Sad to say but beyond logo and quantum physics logo it proceeds to nowhere. Even if you somehow login after hours, it still showing logo and it's animation for all the time. I had some links saved of Ted talks vids and selected them to open up in this app but unfortunately, it doesnt. Subs are missing or diesnt load. Data saving, skim silence & playback speed for podcasts is missing. What a 🗑️ update. Disappointing update. Uninstalling. Will limit my usage for TED to desktop only."", ""Finally after many months it runs on Android devices. I could listen to all main video speech in audio mode but in this version it isn't possible to choose video or audio and if I want to just listen, the app force me to listen to some podcast like ted radio hour or other related podcasts.They are not main speech and it is too bad. please solve this too."", ""The TED app is literally unusable on dual-screen phobes like the Surface Duo 2. The screen is cut off and all the text is huge. It's like is squeezing the Android tablet version onto a phone screen. It's useless. Please fix."", ""Very clunky! App constantly does NOT respond to expanding the screen, clicking to go back, clicking on saved lists etc... Definitely expected more; I don't know...like, for the app to actually function correctly! And yes, I restarted my device and reinstalled the app, multiple times to no avail!"", ""It's a buggy app for my device. I can't use it with ease 😭, always delayed responses especially when clicking the navigation bar icons that's placed at the bottom. The overall interactions is delay."", 'No Chromecast support, and just keeps playing in the background with no notification when the app is closed. This app used to be much better than this.', 'I needed this App to make my small world more interesting and knowledgeable. I am a war time American disabled veterans who like others find their lives are more demanding And ❓ confused.Alot more being at the wrong place and demanding and choosing the correct outcome to a situation. We now have to think before we open the doors of life. Thank you program Ted!!!', ""Hi. Earlier Ted App was awesome. But from few months it can't even open. When I open Ted App, it shows opening screen as TED in red words. After that there is one preloading gif with like proton, neutron and electron moving. And the same gif carries for more than 10 minutes. But still app doesn't even load or proceed. I don't know whether I am getting videos or not."", ""Very disappointed you removed the Cast feature from this app. Please bring it back. I bought a Chromecast partially because I wanted to cast TED talks to my TV, now I realize I wasted my money because you randomly removed it, even though its been a feature for years. Took me all day to even find anything online that mentioned the change. Almost everything said to just click the cast icon in the corner and it'll work."", ""I commented earlier today about the app not loading. I tried again, waited more, used a vpn, changed some settings hoping it will make it work and it works! I'm not sure what was the reason but I think I should have waited more the first time. Thank you _____ I disabled battery saver, gave the app all the permissions and cleared the cache. Not sure if these are the reasons it started working. I also waited two to three minutes for it to load."", 'New version is slow and works very poorly or not at all, takes forever to load, and I preferred the chronological display of new talks as with the old version of the app. ""Submit"" button for feedback in the app doesn\'t work.', 'The app freezes after watching 1 video everytime. I have to close it and restart again to use it. Other than that, I am not able to search or access any other section of the application. Kindly fix this issue', ""Used to have the TED app a while back, really enjoyed it back then. Recent version(s) don't seem to have Chromecast support anymore (why?!?), Rendering it useless for my use case - uninstalling from my device TED devs - please lmk when you re-add Chromecast, I'll be happy to reinstall and review accordingly."", ""It's a brilliant, informative app but I'm unable to change playback speed after the recent update. Please get that back. And also, enable subtitles when full screen is not on. These would make the app flawless!"", 'Nice app and a special hats off to the feedback team for Playstore Ted talks app. Because whenever I contact a customer service or something like that team, they usually reply me with an already created template which is also used for others. But here u guys are giving different replies for different users. Great job.', ""The latest update has made the UI look much better but it has a lot of bugs. 1. The option to change playback speed is no longer there. Please bring it back. 2. To access subtitles, I have to go to the fullscreen mode necessarily. It doesn't show on the normal screen. 3. The Ted-Ed videos keep pausing on their own. Not a buffering problem, but they pause and the user has to manually press play. Highly inconvenient."", 'I used this app daily and I have been enjoying thoroughly. Unfortunately, the last big update brought up a couple changes that made my user experience worse. In particular, you can no longer change the speed of the video, and that was a really useful feature for me. I hope it comes back in a future update. UPDATE: it\'s impossible to remove talks from ""My List"". I removed a few, both watched and unwatched, but when I opened the app again they were there again. Tried a few times, same result.', ""I could get over the re-design of the app (although in my opinion, it's very much taken a turn for the worse) however, I cannot find Chromecast support anywhere in the app. Searching the internet for answers and there appears to be no solution other than referencing former versions of the app which had it. Casting the screen and then playing the video works, but it comes through at fairly low resolution and a bit jerky. A real shame."", 'The TED is one of the best platform to learn interesting stuffs. I always enjoy watching things which normal people do not do. But to watch these videos we need speed. Please give the feature for increasing the video speed. It is really necessary. Also the videos watched on the websites and on the android app are not synchronising. I hope you will consider the same.', 'Still great content, but the recent app overhaul is extremely disappointing. So far, it seems to have lost functionality. The list of new talks is a small fraction of what there was on the old home screen. The control to change the playback speed seems to be missing. I usually watch at a higher speed. The new app looks nice though.', ""The new version is a massive step backwards. Scrolling through My List is almost impossible. Videos I've removed from the list appear back again next time I open the app. The ability to change the playback speed has been removed. As has the ability to cast to another device. Looks good though 😔""]",False,"['org.wikipedia', 'org.coursera.android', 'com.blinkslabs.blinkist.android', 'com.udemy.android', 'org.khanacademy.android']",com.ted.android,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ted.android&hl=en&gl=us,"['com.ted.android.tv', 'com.ted.B2CMasterclass', 'com.ted.TEDMasterclass', 'com.ted.android.conference']"

However you guys are really falling short on support. We paid for a annual subscription two weeks ago, and emailed as well, but still haven't received any app activation. Edit: Update - after I posted here, I've got a lightening fast response and resolution for my issue. Amazing!!"", ""My son is ahead of his class because of TODO MATH. This is the BEST MATH APP on the app store. I tried a few apps and observed which one he used the most. This was the best decision I made to help my son learn math up to Grade 1, especially during the lockdown. He's only 5 but doing math at 7 year old level. For the best results, parents should definitely help their children through the difficult exercises, to encourage excitement about learning long term. Thank you enuma."", 'Debated whether to pay the one/two year fee as it seemed to be incredibily expensive, but bit the bullet. There seems to be a lack of decent maths apps for kids, and this is good. However £80 pounds for a 2 year subscription seems extortionate, having now seen what is on offer. Maybe a lifetime subscription at this price, might be more pallatable, or some ongoing discount for regular subscribers. The daily challenge is good, but the reward at the end could be a bit more interesting/entertaining.', ""By far the best math app I've seen. Very popular with the kids too. A real win-win situation. Hint: For weak readers, I recommend the highest kindergarten level instead of the 1st grade level. 1st grade level requires reading some instructions and it simply became too frustrating. There are some voice recorded instructions in the first grade level, but not enough for dyslexic kids. Also, the color palette and decor for 1st grade somehow dissappointed my kid. It felt more melancholy somehow. I would LOVE to see material that introduces 100 vs 10 vs 1 and how you line them up when adding vertically and why you do so (don't know what that is called). There are some levels (in the free practise section) that address the subject but they all assume previous teaching and they don't do that introduction per se. Would that be possible?"", ""Would Give 5 stars IF you add 3rd grade math becuase it says for 4-12 and I'm 8 and I'm in 3rd grade and there's no third grade math update: now I'm 9 and I'd really like the game if you let me play more than 6 lessons for a free trial in one day. thanks for responding to me"", ""Fab but price is off-putting. This app is perfect for my children and they actually enjoy learning maths now but unfortunately for the yearly subscription it is just too expensive when I'm unsure how long they will maintain interest. If there was a monthly subscription available it would be worth paying once the trial period ends and much more feasible for those on low income."", ""Absolutely love this app!...amazed at how engaged my daughter is...she honestly thinks shes on some treasure hunt as she goes through the activities. Really excited to see how much my daughters math skills will grow. Shes 4 now and as much as I've tried the idea of simple addition/subtraction just couldnt stick but shes got no problem figuring it out with this app. On top of all of that I had a few issues setting it up on my device but their customer service is excellent. Highly Recommend!"", 'I am so happy to find the option in french!! Thank u so much', ""My 5 yr old (who usually hates educational apps) enjoyed playing on this app for awhile, so I thought I'd look into unlocking the rest of the content. I was shocked at the price! As a low-income family we simply can not afford a yearly subscription at that level, not to mention who knows how long my daughter would continue playing it, and most of the sub time would probably be wasted. If it offered a monthly sub, maybe $5 to $7, I would have done it. It's really a shame that the developers created such a price barrier to learning."", 'My 6 year old found it fun. It progressively gets more challenging. I wish the instructions were read out loud. The content is good. I wish there was a monthly subscription. $80 for 2 years for an APP is expensive.', 'Great app. Just needs some small fixes. -When my boy writes a 9 it thinks its a 4 sometimes. And when he writes 4 it thinks its 21. - The games where you drag numbers or pictures to a location auto snaps it into place if its correct. So my boy has learned to just drag the number around until it auto snaps in, instead of solving the problem.', 'Great when it works, but in some games like Patterns it just freezes in the middle of the game. Minimizing the app I can still hear the background music. Using on a Galaxy Tab A 10.1', 'This is an incredibly useful app for teaching children the relationships between different elements of mathematics. The relationship between counting and shapes, and a general appreciation for symmetry is developed. I have used this app with my son for more than an year now and he enjoys it very much. Thank you Enuma! A note for Indian users: payment for subscription via UPI is buggy inspite of the app not having automated renewal. Payment via NetBanking is a more dependable route.', ""My daughter loves this app. She didn't like studying math. So everyday it was like a war to do it. But after changing a method to learn from just a paper and a pancil to this app, she can't wait the time to stdudy math. It's incredible to me! Thank you for making this app."", ""My 3 year old loves it and actually learns now. She knows how to write numbers now. Totally worth the subscription, i love how i can look at my child's progression as well. I recommend to all parents."", 'My kids love this app! They are learning so much while they think its a game! Its very easy on the eyes since its very colorful! Highly recommend!', 'keeps crashing on my chrome book have sent many feedbacks and no response.was able to use the free version now paid and it wont work deleted everything power washed my computer yet sill not working i want my money back as i cant use it on my chromebook.', ""I have to delete it because it won't even open. I refuse to give it access to all my files and it won't open. There is no reasonable excuse for these apps to have access to all your personal media."", 'Great foundation building for toddlers and preschoolers! However i cannot seem to subscribe, it takes me to the homepage instead. Is there a bug?', 'Good app, but not available on Amazon Fire tablets. The kids can only play on my phone, not their own devices. Make app available on this format and it would be 5 stars', 'Kind of easy but I think it teaches 2nd and 3rd graders basic multiplication which is great.', 'Content is pretty good so far, but the app seems eye watering-ly expensive. Think there are much cheaper decent alternatives', 'u have to pay and can not be under 13', ""I LOVE IT! For my disability it helps a lot. Just if there's more games this this from this maker."", ""Only 1 year and 2 year subscription model and a pretty steep price. But it's best in class."", 'First this app is superb.and it helps me to do multiples and divisions.so I think this app is more better than hit the button maths Because that one is 11dhirhams and todo math is free.', 'Deceptive!
