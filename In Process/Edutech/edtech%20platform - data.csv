The title of the current section and video should be front and center as you are watching. It's frustrating having to scroll down through the entire list of sections for that course to find the title of the current video playing. Needs a better user interface"", ""I have many courses on my account (that I've paid for) and I have been using udemy for years. Suddenly in the middle of watching a lecture, the app decided the it won't cast anymore. I've tried to cast to 3 different chromecast devices (that were manufacured by google) and had the same issue, rebooted the phone, cleared memory, and re-installed the app, still the same issue remains. Many people on forums complaining about this, and I've contacted Udemy support - they are doing nothing"", ""I sincerely enjoy Udemy because of the great courses, but after having it for a few years I don't understand why there isn't a dedicated TV app. Chromecast is unstable with Udemy specifically. I can hardly get it to work. It often skips or returns to previous videos. Part of the enjoyment is watching courses on a big screen like you're in a classroom. If they actually manage to change these issues, I will proudly rate the app 5 stars."", ""I love this app for watching and keeping track of my courses BUT the reason i won't give the app 5 stars is because for whatever reason the courses individual lessons get disorganized. I'd understand if it was a one off issue but it's come up multiple times across multiple courses. Ex. Individual Lessons are numbered My current course shows them in this order Section 1 1, 2, 3, 6, 4, 7, 5, 8 The sad part is even tho they're separated by lessons numbers 6, 7, 8 are part of Section 2 originally"", 'Feb. 24 - after the update, can no longer access all of my courses through the app. When I click ""load more"" in my learning, nothing happens even though I\'ve purchased upwards of 50 courses. Only about 10 or so are accessible. 30/12 update - can no longer download course resources within the app 19/12 QA are easy to navigate. Course videos are good quality, ability to take notes and download lectures, as well as adjust playback speed.', ""Beyond frustrated with this app, I don't think anyone working on it actually uses it. All of the ways I try to watch, like on a plane via offline downloads or in my living room via Chromecast while eating, either barely work or not at all. Laughably, on a plane, I have to disconnect from the onboard network to get it to play files *locally* on my device. Streaming to Chromecast either doesn't work at all, or it breaks in frustrating ways like playing the same video over and over. I give up."", ""The Udemy app continuously stops on its own or crashes on both android & ios. I have tried using it on chrome browser, 3 different Android phones, an Android tablet, and 1 iphone and it's the same on all the devices except on the browser it keeps stopping on its own but doesn't crash. The app is even worse when trying to play the videos on a TV. When casting it from the browser it keeps stopping. I've been trying to use the app for years and I keep giving up because it's so bad."", ""The app simply does not work with Chromecast anymore, at least with Android. Just displays an error message when trying to cast. The app has been re-installed a few times and the Chromecast was rebooted, every other app I have works fine but this app will not.

No indication of what it\'s doing, when it will finish, etc. None of my courses are listed. Useless Update: I guess all you have to do is give it a bad review and it will decide to work now. Not giving it any more stars though.', ""I've been a user for several years. I love the service: courses are many and inexpensive. The app, however, is a piece of trash not fit to install. It is unresponsive, slow, unwilling to play videos I have downloaded to my phone, and unwilling to save files to the SD card, despite the fact the app allegedly has that ability. I don't know what the people at Udemy are doing but it surely isn't fixing this dumpster fire. They should take a few of their programming courses and fix the app."", ""I like how you can download lectures or whole courses easily to either the SD card or internal memory. Changing the play speed is a great feature - I use it all the time. As my number of courses increases, it's getting harder to manage them. There's simply no way to organize or group courses effectively. This is getting so frustrating, I'm having to drop a star. Also, the app has difficulty playing consistently when my screen turns off or I move between apps."", ""Udemy is an excellent service and company that I am very grateful for (5/5). However, the app itself is insanely buggy. It's trash. Simply getting to the list of lessons in the course requires me to go back to the home screen and select the course all over again, which just ends up bringing up the video that's already playing. Then my video player will get locked in full screen mode. I literally have to close the app and reopen JUST to select a different video in the SAME course. So stupid."", ""This app I a HUGE disappointment. It has very limited settings. Videos automatically when you click on a course and you can't turn it off. It gives you the option to use an SD card, tells you it saving to it, but when you check the SD card in settings, it's all saved to internal storage, and then refuses to save to the SD card once it has eaten up all your internal storage. They also don't have in-app assistance or issue reporting. The website they want you to use is primitive a pain to use."", ""I like the course, but the app is probably the worst thing I've ever used on a phone. Want to download videos or the whole course? no problem you can do that, but you certainly can not play those downloaded videos if you have little or no internet connection. try uninstalling, reinstalling, airplane mode, jump through hoops and stop being able to get texts, because these guys are terrified of piracy and can't come up with a secure way to deal with it. streaming sites pull if off, but not udemy"", 'Courses are ok. There are two thing I dont like though. Casting the video lectures to Chromecast always results in the very first video of the whole course being played. To know how long a particular section is going to take to finish, you have to manually add the time taken by all the videos in that section. Why not show the time each section takes in total? This has been a pain everytime I sit to plan my studies and come up with a timeline to finish the course.', 'Can\'t download your course? You can fix the ""trying to download, crashes app"" in v7.20.1 (this is current info as of 1/31/22) by downloading each course lesson individually. Yes, it\'s a pain to do. But at least you can have the courses offline. The 3* is reflective of the fact to remedy this issue I had to comb through the support comments. The app, content, and overall user experience (minus this incredibly annoying bug) has been great, otherwise.', 'Suggested improvements for the app 1. While playing on 2x speed, audio on videos produces weird noises. I tested this on the website as well. Only downloaded videos do not have this problem 2. When switching to full screen mode, video should be able to rotate to the orientation which the user has held his phone. Sometimes the video shows up upside down', ""Despite downloading the videos, it still uses the data when viewing it. I have to physically turn off my data service in order to use the downloaded video. Also, it always automatically plays a video after clicking on a course. It doesn't not give me the option to pause it immediately, only after the video loads and waste a few seconds of playtime. Lastly, the video continues playing in the background, despite closing the application and going to another app. I would hope the video pauses."", ""More concerned with anti-piracy measures than facilitating learning. Can't screenshot slides from videos (changes to a black screen), closes when you switch to a note taking app, plays the wrong video when you return, downloads break more often than not (4 of the last 36 attempts worked), and overall unresponsive. A video that I downloaded that worked yesterday no longer works today. It's a mess. But hey, at least I can't steal the content I'm paying for."", ""Great content, garbage app. Constant connection and sign-in problems! Can log in on phone, but not tablet (credentials are saved to password manager on both devices, wont work with/without vpn). Can't log in with a VPN on any device, 2 different VPNs tried. Udemy, I love your content, but this app is trash. I've contacted support, no response or they can't fix it. Pluralsight is looking better and better..."", ""I do like Udemy but I don't use it as much as I would like to because I'm not always able to get an internet connection. Luckily, Udemy has added the ability to install courses so I don't have to bootleg the courses I paid for. Unfortunately, this feature only works with Android/iOS and it does not save to the SD card even though there is an option for it. So, I can't install my courses onto my Chromebook as it doesn't have a lot of internal memory."", ""Casting is extremely busted, was hoping to use it for learning while running on treadmill but have tried multiple times. It keeps jumping to a previous video, no way to even skip ahead when it's casting to even work around it going to a previous lesson. Auto advance doesn't work either in casting. I have a unifi network with the access point near, new 4k Chromecast and pixel 6 so it isn't my equipment as I can cast multi other apps with zero issues. Can't get around with screen mirror either."", 'It cannot cast to Chromecast. I\'ve attempted to cast to three devices from my Pixel 6 Pro with same result. The target device displays ""Waiting for the Lecture"" but it never comes. The app displays ""There was a problem with Chromecast. Please try again"". I can cast to the same devices from YouTube, etc., the problem is not with Chromecast. Update: The support agent said paid courses cannot be cast. Claimed casting support is a myth. What\'s the point of showing cast button?', ""That it takes *forever* to load and play lectures when I have poor connectivity is a huge pain. I pre-dowloaded the lectures so that poor connectivity wouldn't be a problem but the app takes ~60 seconds to load and then ~20 seconds for a cached video to start playing is pretty embarrassing. Otherwise, I'm enjoying the course I bought!"", ""Even after several updates, this app is still garbage. Poor app experience, videos jump ahead, casting is inconsistent, controls to play, skip ahead or back don't work sometimes while casting. Inconsistency with app remembering where you left off in a course. Overall it's extremely buggy as there are too many issues to list. Casting is completely broken. App needs to be thoroughly tested and bugs worked out before releasing to users."", ""Awesome app over all. Has a few bugs that could be worked out of it. My only real problem I've had was when I have a few courses downloaded the app would crash in low service areas. If you only download 1 course at a time you should be good though. Fix that and the app would be perfect."", ""App plays videos out of order and frequently says there are issues with casting to Chromecast devices. Ran into these issues on two separate Android devices as well as two separate Chromecast devices (Vizio smartcast and Google TV device). Had to switch to use their website since the mobile app is having trouble. Guessing there is no QA or that they aren't being thorough in their testing."", ""Casting/mirroring option buggy. When I cast (option within app) what's on the screen to a device, it plays a random lesson, not what's on screen. When I use the screen mirroring option (option on my phone), it shows everything on my screen but the actual video playing. It's a just a black square but the correct lesson is playing and I can see everything else on the screen just fine. I'm using an adroid device."", ""Don't use if you plan to Chromecast. I'm watching a series of lectures and numbers 10 and 11 (so far) won't cast. The app shows #9 and then jumps to #12. When I contacted support, they said (quite rudely) that it's not avaiable for all lectures. This makes no sense. Why is the Cast icon even showing for lectures that supposedly won't work?"", ""I have used this app for a few years now and it still surprises me how many bugs there still are. The most common that I run across everytime I use it is one that will randomly start playing the next video (and it will sometimes check mark the original video you were watching for you, making it hard to tell what you've missed). Udemy itself is great, but they clearly need some new people on the app development team."", ""Developers need to look at issues that we address here. Video from the index jumps to different ones, and it didn't happen on the browser. Video is unable to cast to Google Chrome, app display error while GChrome displays waiting for the lecture. I cleared cached, uninstalled, reinstalled, and it is still happening. I need to cast the lecture to my TV because I want to watch the video while having hands-on experience. Please fix the issue. Thank you."", ""The course was $14.99, but when added it to the cart and went to check out the price was changed to $89.99. Also, all courses were about $15, I logged out and logged back in 5 mins later and all of the prices were increased by A LOT! At this point I'm not yet sure if this was a technical difficulty or company's tricky greed. ü§î"", ""Over all the courses are good and there is a fair amount of courses to pick from. Offline is non existent. If you dont have a net connection it will not play offline downloaded courses. The auto play when you open a course also SUCKS. I use two devices to view my courses. Sometimes the other device doesn't update right and it will AUTO play the wrong one. You also cant just jump into the course to view notes without it autoplaying.... which if your offline will crash the app."", ""For being an education platform, this Udemy app should be top notch and easy to navigate. The latter is true. This app has great potential to go from mediocre to awesome if you would fix little annoying things. For example you could fix the issue of the 'load more' button not functioning on the mobile phone app. I use the Galaxy Note Plus and I don't see my other courses because the app won't load them all. Please fix."", ""Edit 2: This app is not usable even on my phone anymore. I can't watch any videos, downloaded or not. I am connected to the internet and YouTube works perfectly. I can't put up with this anymore. Time to start using Coursera again. Edit: I can't see half of my courses on my tablet. Original: Video loading is extremely slow, much worse than YouTube. It's possible to download content, so that's good. But the app is a bit clunky. 3/5 overall."", ""Overall, I'm a fan of this app. I love being able to watch courses on my phone or cast them to my TV and it has many of the features that I liked with the browser version. But it still needs some work. The autoplay is random at best. Sometimes it will play several in a row and then suddenly need me to click on the lesson to load it. Other times it doesn't autoplay at all. Worst is when it decides to start an episode several minutes in and I have to go in and fix it. A decent app but not perfect."", ""The actual service udemy provides is great. It's a good way to learn new skills from insightful people, for a very affordable price. That said, the app is garbage. Yes, the videos take forever to load and don't play well, just like other reviewers have commented. But what's worse is that the app is incredibly difficult to navigate, classes are difficult to search for, and there are multiple courses which I have purchased that just don't appear at all on the mobile version."", ""A very good platform to learn new things, I passed my Comptia exams with the Total Seminar courses. I highly recommend Udemy.  My issue is with the app itself and the ads that pop up. There's nothing more annoying than a pop-up ad in the middle of a lecture of a course I paid for.    This seems to only happen on the App, I would recommend that anyone using it just download the lessons and play them in Airplane mode or just access them through a browser."", 'So far, so awesome! Just started my first course. Life coaching, no real direction in mind to use this practically, just wanted to know more about the subject. Great layout and lots of information. I\'d say it pays to do side research on the instructors prior to purchase, as I did see some ""quacks"". Be smart and think about the content before just jumping into a course.', 'Excellent interface, videos work well, and all around good e perience.

It does not allow for screen rotation, so video presentation is limited to whatever the width (not length) of your screen is. It has an option for audio only, so you can cut back cell data usage while you\'re just listening. While using cell data, it also unexpectedly pauses, skips, and decides that you\'re done with a lecture while there are still several minutes to go. I haven\'t noticed this with WiFi data, but also haven\'t given it a thorough testing. Probably the second-most annoying part is that the app wants to launch every time I unlock my phone. I have absolutely no idea why. TL;DR? Sure you\'re going to be able to get your Great Courses stuff. Aside from that, it needs a lot of work. I\'d say ""one star, would not recommend"" except that the primary function works.', 'I LOVE the great courses. However, their apps have been lagged and not well designed. One good example is that I have to click individual episodes and download them. The app designers could have provided an option to download an entire course with just one click. Also, it is hard to know if a download has started or not. Wondrium app is still buggy and laggy. Hope it soon falls into the hands of good developers and designers', 'The library of courses from The Great Courses is great to have, but this mobile app is lacking in two quality of life features and fixes that would make it great. The first one is playback continuing after turning off the phone or putting the phone on standby. Both audio and video playback stop after pressing the power button to turn the display off. Audio playback continues for a few minutes and then stops. Video playback stops immediately. The second is keeping captions on downloaded videos.', '06/25/2021: Video plays for only a few seconds, then stops- as if ""paused"". To resume playing I have to click the video and press the ""play"" icon. Then it plays a few seconds and pauses again. This infuriating behavior occurs for both live streaming and downloaded video playback. This doesn\'t happen on the iPad, only on Android on my Samsung Galaxy S9+. Update: 02/12/2022. No resolution. This apps completely sux on Android, and no help from Wondrium. Just lame responses.', ""The content is fantastic but there are some minor complaints. I wish there was a way to see subcategories of subjects. I also would like it if there was a feature that allowed me to view the introductions to various courses in quick succession, sort of like an educational version of TikTok. It'd be a cool way to explore different courses without having to manually search for everything."", 'If I could leave zero stars, I would. Since becoming Wondrium we can no longer stream through Roku to use our subscription or access our previously purchased great courses. We tried reloading, changing the password, etc. Nothing worked. We contacted customer service. They apologized for the inconvenience, confirmed that we had paid our subscription and it is paid for the next 3 months (quarterly billing plan) but offered no help in fixing the problem. Used to be a good service, now it is a scam. Nov 17th Update: Thank you for trying to help. Yes, we knew they were two different Roku channels. When you go to the Great Courses the channel tells you to go to the Great Courses Plus channel. Then when you try to load Great Courses Plus, Roku says there is no such channel. The Great Course Plus channel is what we had that worked fine, until it switched to Wondrium.', ""Basically gives you free college courses on your own time from home! If you call Wondrium (before signing up) they'll give you a code to pay 1/2 price forever! Works on my Roku, firestick, & Android. When I use on my Android, app gives you choice of video or audio only. Listening with audio allows my screen to go dark while still playing. New courses always being added, a favorite list, & great search option. A+"", ""I like this service. There doesn't seem to be another like it. While other learning apps focus on career advancement, this app is for people who just like to learn new things. I was one of those weird people who enjoyed being in class more than partying while at college, and this service captures what is like to be in class. I really enjoy being engrossed in lectures by professors who are knowledgeable and passionate about what they teach."", ""Why is the quality so bad? Video quality seems to cap at 720p, which honestly is fine for me, but the audio sounds so bad most of the time. There is no question that there is a great wealth of information here, if you can grit through it. It's like Audible quality, tuned smartly for voice to sound okay at low bandwidth, but distractingly bad when you notice it. It also keeps telling me I'm not on wifi and interrupting my viewing when I def am on my home wifi. The constant popups say otherwise."", ""Content: 5 stars. App performance: 0 stars. Trying to cast from my phone to my Vizio TV with Chromecast/Google Assistant built in fails. On courses with the audio option it plays the audio, but on video-only courses it refuses to play. On my TV. üòí I'm paying for this subscription specifically to use in our homeschool, so only watching it on my phone is NOT a viable option."", 'I was a heavy user of the previous version of this app and it was great! I love The Great Courses Plus and the app was simple but effective. Now the new version, I\'ll admit, is certainly more aesthetically appealing. Being able to collapse different course titles in the ""Downloads"" view is helpful, and I like having quick access to the PDF course guides. However, this version also took a few steps backwards: 1) Why can\'t we store videos on SD card anymore? Will TGC bring that back or has it been permanently removed? The videos take up a LOT of space and I was running low as it was. 2) Now all videos play with the status bar and button bar permanently visible instead of in full-screen view. Could you please at least provide a setting so users can choose whether they want full-screen or non-full-screen playback? 3) Whenever I\'m downloading a video for offline playback all the images on the screen start flashing. Not a problem but annoying and looks unprofessional.', ""2020-04-16 (revised to 3 stars) The folks at Great Courses Plus are obviously working on improving the user experience and have made a significant progress over the past 2 weeks. The latest version of the app (version 5.2) times out less frequently and hasn't crashed on me yet. Therefore, the original 1 star review is no longer warranted. There is still room for improvement, but kudos to TGC for the progress so far. 2020-04-04 (original review) The 1-star review is for the new release of the Android app and the lack of support for it. First general problems: The app hangs, crashes, and will go into spinner mode until you exit and restart it. This happens multiple times daily. And when it's not doing those things, it can be painfully slow. I suspect much of the slowness is due to a new back-end system implemented by the Great Courses. Things have gotten substantially worse after the upgrade to the new system (when all of the device passwords were reset). Specific bugs: 1) Speaking of passwords, the Android app has a 20 character limit for the password, even though the website will allow you to configure a longer password. There's no warning about this website. I had to figure it out the hard way. 2) The app allows you to download content so you don't have to stream and incur data plan charges. But inexplicably (I think because they never tested this), when you start to play downloaded content while not connected to wi-fi, you get a pop-up warning you that you need to change settings to allow data streaming because you're not connected to wi-fi. But this is the whole point of downloading content. And if you try to exit popup, you have either changed the setting (which I don't want to do - I downloaded the content because I *don't* want to stream over my data plan) or you haven't changed it and playback stops. So I just leave the dialog open and then app eventually crashes once I'm back in wi-fi range. Great... I haven't received a response to any of my recent attempts to contact Customer Service. As a long-time customer of The Teaching Company / The Great Courses (since the time when courses were sent out on cassette tapes) this is disappointing. They used to have very good, responsive customer service. It's a shame because the app and customer service are so bad that I'm ready to cancel."", ""I love the Great Courses, and based upon the content, I was planning on extending past the 30 day trial. However, I'm not sure I will. On my Samsung phone, it pauses every couple of minutes and gets really annoying to keep pressing play. This could be very dangerous for those that try to listen and drive. Also, on my phone, I have to exit the app a couple times in order for my content to appear. The roku app won't keep you signed in so it takes a while to sign in and it's really annoying."", ""The content is great. The app is a little slow and buggy sometimes but that's not a huge deal. The problem I had was strange and was never resolved. I did the free trial with intensions to renew and pay full price the next month. The next month rolled around and I was charged for the subscription, but my account was deactivated. I emailed the team to try getting this figured out and they still haven't fixed this. They refunded me, and they told me they'd fix it but it's been almost a month."", 'The app loses all my information llike Favorites or Downloads when it remains dormant for a period of time. I have to kill the app and restart it and it then remembers everything. In the past I had trouble accessing downloaded courses when I did not have an internet connection. It wants to reverify that you are an active member. I have not tested the latest version. Other than that, the app is great!. Finding, accessing and streaming a huge range of courses.', 'I love the material offered by The Great Courses, but the app has some issues. 1. Several days ago, I downloaded some lectures to listen while on a trip with limited internet access. Upon opening the app, I was greeted with the message ""We have made some changes that require you to upgrade to our latest version"" with no option to continue until the app was upgraded. Very annoying, and kind of defeats the whole purpose of downloading lectures. 2. During playback of lectures, the player will randomly pause, requiring me to manually restart. 3. No Android Auto support for audio lectures.', ""It's nice being able to take the courses with you on the go. The audio-only option allows me to listen in the car during my commutes. My only issue is I wish the size of the closed captions was adjustable. It is so teeny tiny on my S9 that it's pointless to try to use them. I don't really use this app as much as I would like because of this. I have a slight auditory processing issue and watching things with captions is very helpful for me."", ""Update: I added a star. The app is no longer struggling to load and play audio and video. Previous: The app itself is nice. But it really seems to struggle with audio and network interruptions - phone and sms. I've had to go as far as force stopping and purging local content to get it running normally again. It's unfortunate because it makes the product hard to enjoy."", ""Love the great courses but the app is terrible! Every single time I try to go back to where I left off it locks up, just loading forever. Occasionally I can do a search but cannot use the back button so no way to navigate to the menu, I just have to restart the app and loading in general is very slow so I'm never quite certain if I need to wait it out or restart. Once I actually get to the lectures playing audios/videos seems to work well."", 'The service is awesome but this app is an exercise in frustration. I will start a lecture and listen as I clean the house but invariably playback will stop and I have to pull out my phone, pause, then play again. It also never goes on to the next lecture without me having to do the same. It often stops playing new lectures altogether after two or three. Then I have to actually kill the app and restart it. This happens when downloading the lectures, too. It is pretty to look at, but I wish they had put more effort into smooth, reliable operation.', ""Best new feature: you can now download lectures in audio and listen offline. (Before, you could only download video lectures.) The app now marks your place in each lecture, even if you skip between lectures or courses. It now freezes much less often. If it gets wonky or slow, try restarting your phone. If you need to pause for more than a few minutes, quit the app and restart it when you're back. If you press play after pausing too long, it drops you at a random point in an earlier lecture."", ""Excellent value for the money. I listen to lectures in audio format when I'm driving for work and watch the videos when I have time at home. Seamless transitions between the two make it possible to keep up no matter what you're doing. I've learned so much thanks to these guys from Great Courses and Wondrium is just a step up in content. The only downside is poor app integration across devices. Don't count on seeing this on flex boxes, game consoles, or some other streaming devices."", ""Great content. Horrible app. Audio courses will play for 20 seconds and then stop so you have to keep pressing play every 20 seconds to get through the lecture. I thought the newest update would fix this, but it actually made it worse. Too many times I've opened the app to listen to a course and it simply wouldn't load. For a few days the app said I wasn't a member and didn't have access to the content. Really disappointing. I paid for a 3 month subscription and can't access anything."", ""There's so much content, and such a wide variety of lectures and courses to choose from along with guidebooks. Another awesome feature that's extremely useful for me is the ability to quickly switch from video format to audio format whenever I have to go somewhere or do something. My only recommended improvement would be to add something like a monthly credit to buy a singular lecture or course, and own it forever. Similar to Audible. All in all, great app. Recommend it a lot. üëç"", 'I love the Great Courses and was excited to subscribe to the Great Courses Plus. The content is excellent and the app is nicely designed. Unfortunately, I am unable to actually watch any video using the App. I have an app that runs in the background and updates information on my pull down menu every 5 minutes. Every time it updates, this App pauses the video or audio that is currently playing. Please try to fix this. If the app would automatically resume playing, it would be better. Thanks', 'The updated app includes the ability to download audio versions of each lecture, plus the associated guidebook. These are terrific improvements over the former version. Moreover, the functionality and user interface are great. However, I would still like to see the capability to download all lectures in a course with one button instead of clicking on all individually.', ""I really do not like this app. When it works it works well. When it screws up it does a great job! If your multi-tasking with this app you can forget about it. I paused my lecture, used GPS for around 15mins then went back to lecture and my lecture was gone. I had to restart and it doesn't restart from the beginning but it also doesn't restart from where it was initially paused either. That problem is bothersome but the app will aslo go as far as freezing up and will become unresponsive."", ""I like all the content the app has, however it's a little buggy. If I'm locking my screen , I can pause the app from the lock screen. However, if I click play from the lock screen, Not only does the course I want to listen to play, but also some random course I was listening too previously also starts playing. It's a little frustrating to have to open the app each time I want to resume my course"", ""I love the courses (selection and content), but the platform is terrible. I stream the courses at home and in my car. If I don't remember to open the app before leaving home, it does not recognize my ID and password when I try to use it in the car. When away from home,, I can't close the app because I have the same problem. Some of the older courses don't have an audio only option which uses more data if you stream them in your car. All the courses should have an audio only option."", ""The app used to be pretty bad and had a difficult to use UI. Also couldn't delete individual downloaded lectures, you had to delete a whole course of downloaded lectures. All these issues are now gone and the app runs much more smoothly now after an update that came out a late last year. Only thing I can think of that needs to change is making all lectures available for audio download, as I think there are still some that are available for video download only."", ""The content is wonderful. The app is not. It rarely remembers where I am in a lecture series, both within a given lecture and where I left off between them. It says that you can save the lectures to your SD card, but you can't. Also, the opening screen should be my watchlist, not some random collections of lectures in which I have no interest."", ""Edit: reduced to 1 star. After more than 2 years and hundreds of hours of lectures, I'm removing the app and canceling my subscription. Audio streaming has been failing to load with increasing frequency over the last year, and has now become entirely non-functional. Same issue on iphone X and Samsung S20+. Verizon, tmobile, wifi, all the same. I have one course to finish in video mode and I'll be canceling my subscription, and it's a real shame."", 'As the others said, the content is great. The lecturers are good, and the topics are many and interesting. The applications (be that on Win 10, Fire or Android) leave a lot to be desired. There is no consistency across the board (which happens when someone hires different contractors to build them without having an overall standard), and unfortunately the android app is just useless in my case because I cannot listen to the lectures, only watch them. Cancelled my subscription after an year.', ""Great content let down by a bad app: * You can download content, but you must be online to access (why bother?). * You cannot download audio only for many lectures, leading to needlessly big downloads/data. * When you download the video and let your screen sleep, the audio stops. * There's no easy way to see where you left off. * Way too much focus on video for what is great audio content. * No Android TV support at all. All in all, there's a lot that feels poorly thought out and woefully executed. The inability to play content offline is absurd. All the major streaming services have that figured out, but here it's a mess. I still kinda recommend the overall product, but the app makes it absolutely painful. It's a mess."", 'Good content. Greatest problem is that you cannot download the audio of a video course. Thus you have to stream it if you are away from wifi; not good if you have a limited data plan. Downloading the video and playing it later would work but for my battery being more quickly depleted by playing the video just to listen, not watch. May quit when my free trial is up.', ""This app has been amazing, there are so many learning opportunities. I've been listening mainly to history lectures as I work from home but there is so much more I'd love to dive deeper into when I have time. There was recently an issue where my subscription was canceled without my input but they helped me sort that out. Something to do with Google play, not the apps fault. Point being, they have always been very helpful to me when I need it."", ""TL;DR Wonderful learning tool if the audio playback worked consistently. App content has been great so far, but it's good I'm on a free trial because the audio playback is buggy. I drive truck so I want to be able to listen to audio in the background, but I often can't get it to start playing... The loading spinner spins and spins, but no audio. If I choose video, it normally starts in ten seconds or so, but then it stops playing when I send the app to background. It's an irritating Catch 22."", 'If you installed the upgrade that was pushed out on 2/12/2020 and are stalled at the sign in screen (just a spinning circle and the words, ""Signing In""), try going first to the ""Browse Courses"" option at the bottom of the screen and then use the sign in button that is available there. That was the only way I could get past the stalled ""Signing In"" screen that came up whenever I tried to sign in directly from the starting screen. Love The Great Courses Plus. Still room for improvements to the mobile app, but they\'re working on it.', ""The content is genuinely top-notch (I'm often quite surprised by the production quality) and had a wide variety of topics to choose from. The app is a little slow and sometimes buggy, but I expect it'll improve in time. Pricing is kind of expensive, but they're making new courses regularly so it doesn't seem like such a waste to me. I'm overall very happy with Wondrium."", ""Fantastic but dated. Catalogue is huge and the speakers well selected. My only complaint, and unfortunately it's a big one, is how dated all these lectures are. The ones I've listened to are all from the 2000's. Much has changed and been discovered since than. I'm left to wonder how come these arent being rerecorded every few years.
