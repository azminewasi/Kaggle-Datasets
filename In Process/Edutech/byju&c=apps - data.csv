Whenever I open a video lesson, the video quality is so poor that nothing is visible clearly and also the videos take a long time to load, there is a lot of buffering. This is the only issue that I find in this app. It would be very helpful if this problem gets solved. Otherwise, everything is good, keep up the good work. I would be highly obliged if this problem gets fixed. Thank you very much.', ""What just happened!, I was trying to contact byjus via email but this out to work. The app was beautiful and perfect! The updates you guys did are an improvement but I don't understand why the app interface changed. The app was really encouraging and easy to use but now it looks bland and I don't even like using it anymore, the pictures were vivid and cartoonized. (When you enter the app it is just absolutely discouraging)"", ""I don't know what happened to this app. After this latest update (March 2022) it is good that they changed a lot of it in this update. Changing the background to fonts and everything.

Please solve all the bugs in the videos and background"", 'Yeah.. social science and maths are really well explained and taught. But the biggest downfall is the science section and especially physics which is so overrated except few chapters, you would have to re-watch every other a hundred times to understand what they say, I feel their pace too high. They should first elaborate well and then go with their high theatre films. And why in the practices and tests the same bunch of questions repeated a thousand time; that I must is say frustrating 🤣', ""The way the teachers explain things is so good. And the practices right afterwards are useful for sure. I study in an English version college in my country so it's hard to get my study subjects and chapters in an organized way in English. This app is probably exactly what i needed."", 'Very good app. Now I can Clear the concepts with upmost interest. Visualising the concepts instead of mugging up helps to remember best. Videos, activities and tests are very interesting and encouraging. If can will give 5.1 out of 5 stars.', ""The free contents should not be limited because if someone is studying for exam, it hinders their study. The exam date is fixed. So is the study schedule of the individual. If you can't provide, then don't post free contents at all. Instead of waiting for long days to view next videos and revising only 4-5 videos for longer periods till next videos, it's best to install the app right away and go for books or YouTube videos."", 'I really enjoy using byjusexamprep daily quizzes, mock tests, and previous papers. byjusexamprep is a helpful teaching method for teachers. The syllabus structure and timetable are very flexible. I really appreciate the hard work behind the technical people too that they have provided us with proper notes and quizzes. I like byjusexamprep and it is one of the best App.', ""I Gave this app a 3 star rating last month. I don't know if that issue is solved or not BUT the New version released just now is worse. Like seriously!!!! When you pause the video you go back. When you start the video you go back. I can't make notes when it can't go smooth. New version have new things but this thing in particular is a Headache seriously. Hope you fix this ASAP."", ""In IAS subscriptions Early subscribers are dealt by the mentorship nicely but when it has been some time they stop paying attention to your problems and complaints. Its been a whole month I've raised my query. Mails, calls, everything in vain. Everytime I have to repeat my issue and it is very frustrating. They just assure you of transferring calls to seniors and resolving issues but they don't do it. More like government office treatment."", ""This app has the worst customer care services, I've subscribe to it a few months ago and I didn't like it so I tried to contact customer care inorder to cancel my subscription but they don't seem to be of any help and some of them even gets angry when I try to contact them,that is what makes me annoyed. Yea..And and thanks to this stupid subscribtion money is being deducted from my account every month without an end to it. Have some SHAME BYJU'S."", ""The topics on byjus are crisp n clear, fun, and intresting. The reason behind why I've given 2 stars is that, it always asks for the OTP whenever I open the application. It is also annoying when the byjus team calls us to enroll in the classes. When you go on with a particular topic for a few days or so, suddenly it says going at a great pace, denying us to open the topic. After all I had a Average experience with byjus."", ""there's elevator music playing behind every video which can be distracting and the byju's watermark is also distracting and idk if this is just a problem I'm facing but the audio is distraughted. the visuals are nice and help you understand but they also make unnecessary noise which can take away from the main lesson."", 'The teachers are very good and the explanation is beautiful too. My only problem is that the games sometimes get stuck and i have to re-do it 3-4 times. There is no skip option for the games either.', ""App is good but I'm feeling uncomfortable as it is only available in landscape mode in my Samsung galaxy tab A. I would suggest that it must be available in both Portrait and landscape mode so that students feeling better with any mode can perform their best in the paid test series."", 'The app is very good, very beautiful features, But if there was a language option would be very good, such as bengali, hindi etc then the videos would be very convenient to understand. And there is no computer application subject in this app.', ""I have been using this app for a long period of time but today suddenly when I opened one video on it , it is not opening and showing that to access this features is only available to the premiums,to access videos you have to subscribe for byju's.

But in the case of mock tests,it is okay upto the completion of the exam but at the time of submission the app is getting strucked such that we cant see our results and it is showing to write down the exam again. I observed this many times. This is getting problamatic. Hope you guys check it. Thank you', ""I'm a huge fan of BYJU'S The Learning App and I truly appreciate it. It helps us to understand all topics in all subjects the simple ones, even the most difficult topics they teach us in a simple and convenient way and of course the teaching methods of India's Best Teachers are absolutely awesome and amazing including the conversion from difficult topics to the simplest version. I highly recommend to all of you to use this app because Come And Fall In Love With Learning."", ""It's a really good app I love the way teaches us and the explanation is very clear and good we can understand it easily it helps me a lot. But I have one complain whenever I search answers for math question I don't get the right answer its show some another equation or question I have search it other and it show other question. Overall its very good app<8"", ""Its true!!What byju's says is true.Really it makes learning fun by providing 3D visuality for understanding the concepts which is actually amazing❤.There are many concepts which are difficult to imagine but byju's provides us the visuality which is needed perfectly👍👍👌.And even the teachers are perfect!!Very highly skilled.But recently it is taking more time to load. Really very much thanks for your big help."", ""This is the best app ever for studying. It helps you remember everything forever !!

It helps me a lot in my studies. Thank you so much BYJU'S....🙏🙏🙏"", ""Worst experience of all time. Bad customers sevice, disconnects calls as I tell my problems. No replys of emails. Took a loan from for byju's app but after the cancellation request made a month ago no communication is made I have to pay EMIs despite my cancellation but they didnt cancel my subscription. And after 1 and half months of cancellation they haven't refunded my money. And I have to pay EMI on that. want to give zero star but it's not available."", ""The app is good, easy to understand UI but the problem is that videos don't have transcripts. You should add transcripts and written stuff cause vidoes do not always load properly."", ""The latest update is very disruptive while studying because it's start functioning without being commanded like in mid of video it change it's portrait mode to landscape on its own and many more problems are faced using it."", ""It's really a fascinating and interesting app. The video lectures are so animated and the way teachers teach is also great.

I just finished the Tom Morello course, and currently in progress over several other music, film, cooking courses now. Properly dedicating time to the workbook and topics will show results."", ""The reason that this review gets 3 stars instead of 5 is that there are bugs in the app. Particularly if you want to use the app to go back and rewatch a lesson. The lesson loads then ends and moves onto the next unplayed video. You do not have the ability to either reset the episode to the beginning or move the scan bar to the beginning so you can rewatch it. This is a serious issue for me especially because I like using the app instead of the website because it is the only one that can cast to google chrome directly. The classes are fantastic, especially Chris Voss's negotiation one. Be sure to watch his youtube videos and read his book as well!"", ""The content is good, but the app sucks. There is no ability to do full screen, so I'm stuck watching it on the top of my screen. If I leave a lesson, it will resume at that lesson, but it start it over from the beginning. There is also no way to listen to this while using other apps. If I exit out of masterclass, i lose my spot and the video stops playing. It needs to be more like the YouTube app and move to a corner and continue playing. There should also be a podcast feel to it for car play."", 'This review is of the app itself, and not the content of the courses offered. The app is clean, well organized and mostly free of flaws. Flaw 1: If you have watched a video before, clicking on it again takes you to the end and then auto plays the next session. This provides some irritation in watching a session over easily. Flaw 2: An inability to minimize to the background and listen in a podcast esque way. It would be beyond useful to listen to some lessons over again as sound only.', ""I love the program but this app needs work. First, it won't play it you navigate away, so even if you aren't watching the video and just listening, the video must remain open.

The app looks good, and doesn't crash from what I've seen. So it functions. Aesthetically the app looks really nice.

Fix those two things and it's an easy 5 stars"", 'I have enjoyed the classes so far. Such a relaxed setting to learn about things that interest me. I just wish there was an even greater diversity of classes to choose from. More science/technology, computer programming/engineering, brewing, organizing/minimalism/etc. All in all it is a wonderful experience, and hopefully with time the subject matter will continue to expand.', ""I believe the app is better than the web version. Easy to use, easy to find what you have yet to complete, simplistic interface. Even so, it's not perfect. The 'cancel' button to cancel auto play doesn't work, and going back when trying to do the end surveys causes issues. However, I am still pleasantly surprised that those are the only real issues I've ever had with this app. The website has way more issues, mostly with freezing and video playback. More people should use the app. :)"", ""I just sent this to Masterclass help: 12/13/19 Dear MC, There is a major bug that needs to be fixed. When using MC through the app, if the app is paused for say text/telephone/internet/photos, when one resumes play, the app restarts over the class. But it doesn't just restart over, if you are more than one class in, it goes back to the beginning. I'm not sure if it's the beginning of that day, or the whole beginning. This bug has already been mentioned by other people in the app reviews of the playstore, so I'm not sure why it hasn't been resolved or even exists. When I use my app Audible for example, I can still listen to it even though I might be texting or taking pictures. This is HUGE bug. I ended up listening to the same class 5x yesterday because of this bug!!!!!!! Please email me about this."", ""Wonderful resource and teaching tool. I highly recommend Masterclass. Wonderful way to learn and grow one's skill base. I enjoy the variety and expertise of the instructors. Great that it works around your schedule.

I'm new so haven't gotten the opportunity to explore the network aspect but it's good that it's offered. It's worth the membership. I highly recommend it."", ""TLDR; cancel your subscription well in advance of the end if you don't plan to renew. This is not a new issue, as you can see by looking at other one/two-star reviews. Gave a Masterclass as a gift and that year ended. However, it wasn't so clear that the receiving individual needed to cancel their own subscription or be charged. Finding the button to cancel my own subscription wasn't easy either -- I had to log in 2x to find the button BURIED."", ""Video Player is Frustrating. I thought it might be an improvement over the online player, but it doesn't look like it is. The app does not keep a phone (OnePlus 6t in my case) from going to sleep, and sometimes when the app closes or is minimized for any reason, such as calls or screen timeout, you get taken all the way back to second one of the very first video in the series you're watching. The videos are wonderful but the player and app are missing basic capabilities."", ""App is terrible. I like MasterClass so far, but as a person that does a lot of tutorials, the mobile UI on this is subpar. Every phone I've used in the last 10 years has the ability to turn the screen and use it full screen for videos. But this app keeps the video teeny-tiny in vertical orientation only. The video is 1/4 of my screen!!! And the rest of the screen just is filled with a description of the class (not useful after you have read it once), and a list of other videos you can click on. Every TV/Movie streaming service allows the full screen option. Learning apps like Pluralsight, Udemy, LinkedIn Learning, etc - allows full screen option. But this app is barely usable for it's main purpose because of the limitations. MasterClass has such wonderful high-profile teachers, they deserve a comparable app."", 'I want to start off by saying the classes are fantastic, the app itself is what deserves two stars. Not having the ability to download videos ahead of time severely limits when and where I can watch videos, making the whole service much less useful to me. The quality of the video player is not great, pause/play has issues before and after the video, when it is loading, etc. Overall the app offers very little functionality beyond a video player.', 'The content is great. The app has poor functionality. I have to stumble around to find what I\'m looking for. They keep showing you featured instead of ""my list."" Also, when I\'ve completed a course, it\'s still saying incomplete. Also, the course needs to be optimized for folks who listen in the car. Having typed subtitles does not help for car listeners.', ""Really enjoying Masterclass, but the app functions poorly. The app regularly loses track of where I'm at in videos and jumps back to the start of the course. If i am interrupted during a video and have to pause and come back later, the app rarely picks back up in the right spot. Sometimes it will also show that I'm watching one lesson while actually playing the video for another lesson. Working from a computer is really the only way that the classes are worthwhile in my opinion"", 'The content is great, but the app needs work. Each time I return to the app, it asks if I would like to pick up where I left off, but it never returns to the right spot, not even the right lesson. I stop watching lesson 9 at the 6 minute mark, and when I return it wants me to watch lesson 6 from the starting frame. It would also be a nice addition if I could cast to my smart TV. It does cast, but only gives the option to cast to certain devices in my home, none of which are my TV or Roku.', ""4.75, having trouble with playing videos in landscape, but aside from that I absolutely adore how user friendly this is! I know the price is a little steep but for the variety of classes from such a large group of people is worth every penny. Each class has bite sized videos that are thought provoking but not too long so you really absorb the content of one before moving on to another. Love the work books also! They're so helpful when trying to really delve into the discussed topics."", ""I've only had the add and membership for about a day. However, I can't stop using it. I like to be a jack of all trades kind of person, with specialties in a few catagories, but thanks to this app, I can learn loads of different subjects.

Poor app experience, videos jump ahead, casting is inconsistent, controls to play, skip ahead or back don't work sometimes while casting. Inconsistency with app remembering where you left off in a course. Overall it's extremely buggy as there are too many issues to list. Casting is completely broken.

A decent app but not perfect."", ""The actual service udemy provides is great. It's a good way to learn new skills from insightful people, for a very affordable price. That said, the app is garbage. Yes, the videos take forever to load and don't play well, just like other reviewers have commented.

I highly recommend Udemy.  My issue is with the app itself and the ads that pop up. There's nothing more annoying than a pop-up ad in the middle of a lecture of a course I paid for.    This seems to only happen on the App, I would recommend that anyone using it just download the lessons and play them in Airplane mode or just access them through a browser."", 'So far, so awesome!

They claim throughout this is a no-pressure way to learn, but that\'s not true. There\'s a heavy focus on a point system. The App bothers you with notifications to keep your streak going. There\'s tremendous pressure to keep points up & not go into the ""demotion zone."" The ability to remain in your level increases. All this ""no-pressure"" competition damages learning.', 'Using the free version. I enjoy it, but some things annoy me. Every once in a while I get something wrong because of autocorrect or some other technology related issue. Also, they challenge you to learn the language in lots of different ways, which is good, but the randomness of the switching can sometimes trick you. Especially when having to translate what you heard then the next question is not translating but writing out what you heard. Then I run out of lives. Just spoils it a little for me.', ""First, one star off for no way to report bugs in the app. Second star off for a bug worth reporting. This has been a pretty good app, until a couple of weeks ago. I used it for Spanish a couple of years ago, now Chinese for a year. All of a sudden the text in the buttons has the bottom third cut off. Both pinyin and simplified characters. This vastly reduces the effectiveness of the app for learning. I'll switch to another until this bug is fixed."", 'I\'m a little over a year in and want to give this 5 stars but I just can\'t. Overall this is an excellent app, but if you\'re serious about learning you really need the paid version (it\'s worth it). Paid has both a monthly and yearly option and no punishment for mistakes. Problems are that it\'s way too ""gamey"" and having leaderboards makes it stressful. Worse than that is that there are NO grammar rules provided, which negatively impacts learning. Also too cartoonish. Still a great learning tool.', 'This is a good app for learning another language! I had previously downloaded it but didn\'t really use it that much until they finally added Finnish... the language I really wanted to learn. My only two problems I have with this app that I would like to point out are that the whole thing with the hearts and ""running out"" of them is starting to get rather annoying and I find it to be counterintuitive and holding me back. Also, so far, it seems less ""conversational"" content and more piece of one.', ""The whole experience is fun and you are guided through progressively more challenging learning situations. Be careful of technical challenges. Sometimes the microphone doesn't work correctly and you can end up losing a lot of hearts. Outside of this it has been and continues to be a good experience.

Thank you Duolingo."", 'The application is good it increases the level according to your capabilities the only problem that I find is that sometimes you cannot see the pairing exercises on the phone and some translations are weird to the English language. Other than that, it is great. It provides different ways to encourage you to continue learning and some tips to clarify your thinking. I wish it would have more of those. The taking exercise turns off before speaking at times. Thank you for making it free.', ""I've had it maybe 2 yrs and for learning it is great. You do get out of it what u put in it tho so be prepared. My main issue tho is that I get docked streak freezes when I have done the lesson! At first I thought maybe I was wrong but it continues to happen and I've started paying closer attention for that reason. No idea what the issue is. I make sure to watch the ENTIRE AD at the end of my lessons thinking maybe that by closing the app when I'm done it doesn't give me credit. Nope, not it."", ""Decent, but I wish there were better ways to review words you've leavened considering reviewing and repetition is an integral part of learning a new language. You have a list, but I wish when you clicked on a word you learned, it offered the definition and verb conjugation.

I tried to find a forum, but Duolingo deleted all."", ""the continue button (icon?) covers instructions, the exercise where the choices are in little circles aren't centered so you can't see them, some exercises the words you are supposed to select as a choice for what you hear are below the edge of the screen so you can't select them. when the exercise works, they work great. unfortunately about a quarter of the time you can't access the correct answer or it isn't visible on the screen. too bad, it looks pretty good otherwise"", ""This review is for the Korean course. The course has improved significantly since I first started and is a lot more immersive now. I still wish all the new words in each lesson were introduced at the beginning of the lesson instead of as they come, but I can live with that.

I won't pay until it happens."", 'It\'s good for practicing recall, but when you get beyond the basics you\'ll realize that the translations they\'re giving you for certain sentences are approximations not exact translations, which is frustrating.

However, that being said there's a lot of room to improve. First, I'm not 22 and find the whole game like experience annoying and condescending. I don't need points, gems, hearts etc. I would prefer statistics and quantified measurements. I would certainly consider a paid version but nowhere can I find the cost and features listed. I'm not going to buy anything unseen. Providing downloadable vocab lists and progress stats would be a great reason to pay."", ""I've used Duolingo almost 5 years, and learned a ton from it. The quality and depth of each language program is varied - if you aren't learning one of the major ones like French, German, Spanish, English etc. often it is less well-directed, and will offer less explanation, leaving much more for you to do on your own. In general though, it is perfect as an accessory alongside vocabulary, listening, and speaking practice when learning another language."", ""Update: I have to drop the stars because now I'm in the higher levels, the heart thing is preventing me from making any progress. I also can't compete on the leader board with paying subscribers. It's too bad, but I'm done - it's too frustrating. I have had a lot of fun learning Español and freshening up my Deutsch. It's easy to fit in time to study everyday. Duolingo takes the intimidation out of learning a language and has taken the place of all the games on my phone!!!"", 'App is great most of the time!! It is impossible to talk to a person and I have easily lost 1000 credits using a streak freeze when I completed the excercise on the same day!! This may seem menial but it had cost me many hard earned points and I dedicate myself to reaching the 365 day streak. I have numerous screen shots but no way to fix the issue!!', ""Decent app and learning modules. The in app advertisements are a huge pain lately. After each lesson we noramlly have a short ad that you can skip after a short period. Now the ads do not seem to have that option and at the end of the add there is no way close out and continue learning. I must close the app and re-open the app to continue. This is the second time in the last 30 days this has happened. Third strike and you're out!"", ""I've been using Duolingo for about 3 YEARS! now, and really am enjoying the app. The pace of learning is totally up to you, and you can test out of easier levels if you already have some language familiarity. I appreciate the reminders, the variety of speaking reading and translating back and forth. There are challenges, practices, review of past mistakes, lessons, and even stories!!! Try it!"", ""While this has the potential to be a fun way to work on vocabulary for learning a language, the support for the app is nonexistent. The amounts of ads in the free version as well as being locked out for making mistakes makes it almost unusable, so I tried the premium version for my whole family. There were a lot of bugs and issues with getting access to features like following friends or in game power ups. The only thing you can do is to file a bug report, but I didn't get a reply or any help."", 'Duolingo is an excellent app for casual language learning. It is great for learning basic vocabulary, grammar, and does so in a variety of exercises and stories (which I love) to keep one busy. That said, one thing that disappoints me is the decline of the free version. I have used the app long enough to know when it was just ads, and no 5 lives. When they added gems, and the five lives, I knew microtransactions were coming, while ads would remain. First create a problem, then sell a solution', ""Great way to learn Spanish. Much better than text books and memorizing a lot of info. More like learning as a kid by hearing and repetition. Every once in a while though, my answer choice is covered by the check box so I can't respond correctly. Also, it doesn't recognize my microphone so I don't speak. Otherwise, happy with the app."", ""I find it useful for brushing up on a language I already know. I haven't used it to learn an unfamiliar language, but it seems less ideal for that because it doesn't really explain anything. E.g., when an answer is marked wrong, there's no explanation of what specifically was wrong. Obviously there's only so much they can do, since all they have are a bunch of candidate answers that they're matching against, but even with that, I think they could do better. The correct answer they offer may differ in multiple ways from the user-provided answer, but it often turns out that most of those difference are fine, and the real problem was just a hard-to-notice typo. That can result in the user doubting their own correct understanding and just learning to parrot what DL offers as correct. I think it would be better if they showed the closest candidate answer by edit distance, ideally highlighting the difference. I dislike the over-the-top gamification and social elements. I don't really want to solicit pats on the back from friends and family for every little achievement. No doubt their engagement metrics and subscriptions go up whenever they tweak the game to be more manipulative, but I'd turn that all off if it were an option. They added new voice models for their computer-generated text-to-speech for the purpose of having different characters with distinct voices. While the quality of the TTS in general is pretty good, I find it inconsistent, at least for the Italian. For one of the kid voices in particular, it can be really difficult to tell what consonant is supposedly being said. Even knowing from context which words are likely, it's sometimes a guessing game. I wish it were an option to switch to a different voice."", 'Duolingo is fantastic. I am truly enjoying this platform. It makes it extremely convenient and fun to learn a language in this manner. I took Spanish immersion classes my first year of college and spoke it off & on through the years. It has really started to come back. The format the exercises are in make it fun & relatively easy to work through. Cheers!!', ""I love duolingo so much. It's somewhat life-changing. It's an invaluable tool for language learning. It gives me really good brain exercise, and (more importantly) consistent brain exercise. The leader boards, daily reminders etc are so helpful and encouraging for keeping a consistent practice. I highly recommend it to people all the time. Thank you duo."", ""I'm on the 2 week trial to see if I want to buy it for the family. It's actually really good and motivating but once you get to level three you start having memorizing which nouns are masculine, feminine, and neuter. If you had the option to create flashcards (in this app) from each lesson on the words that you're struggling with; this would be a five-star app, no question."", ""It's a decent program, it mostly works as intended. However some longer words when forced to type the question when there is one word wrong but you can clearly see it is the correct word, will be counted wrong. When you speak into the phone it will occasionally not hear what you said and you lose a heart.. its a program designed to make you pay. I would recommend babbel over duolingo"", ""The app itself works as intended. Perhaps it works for some, not for me. It's far too discouraging. To advance, you are obviously competing with bots & people who are plus members. I get it; they want you to pay, but all the advertising pop ups ARE paying... If you work hard to move up, but for some reason can't spend the time, you get demoted and have to work your way back up. How is this encouragement? difficult to figure out sentence structure with no explanations. Too many negatives to list"", ""Duolingo is amazing if you want to learn a new language. With an ample choice of languages, you can pretty much learn any language you want. There is competition to keep you motivated which is great and if your friends join Duolingo, you can compete with them as well. The only problem I see in Duolingo is sometimes when you have to say the words of the language and you don't respond too fast, the audio will just mark you wrong. This may be a problem because of background noise or the system."", ""I think it's a great app, the way they do there adds is perfect, if it were any other way I would delete the app right away. I like that you have the option to have reminders on/off because I hate app reminders. (The following is an edit to the original 5 star review) This app is super buggy. It will allow you to have a 119 steak that your working on go to waste when it bugs out in the middle of a lesson and not allow you to continue. You'll have to restart your lesson after restarting the app."", ""I had trouble learning Spanish since high school. Duolingo has helped me so much. The lessons are broken down into short and engaging sections you can complete in under 10 minutes each. The characters are relatable and their notifications aren't intrusive. I don't usually spend money on apps, but I went ahead and bought the paid version for a year and it's worth it for the extras. I had the free version but I wanted the unlimited lives, extra lessons, and stories to open without spending coins."", ""I use to really love Duo, it was easy and accommodating so could go at my own pace. Unfortunately it's changed to a weird heart system where after so many chances; you have to WAIT to be able to practice again. This is a huge blow to someone who has disabilities memory and learning. I don't learn this way. If it's a tactic to try and get subscriptions I get it(kinda) but you're really hurting those who Want to learn and don't have the money for that sort of thing. Very disappointed"", ""I like this app. It does teach well, but I think it would be better if duo got rid of hearts. It's annoying having to wait another day just for my refill of hearts and practicing the same lessons to achieve more hearts. Everyone should have the option to practice with unlimited hearts but that's my opinion. Also one more thing that's irritating is the leagues. It's hard because your competing against a bot or duo plus people and it's hard trying to advance xp above them. Its very competitive."", 'Fun, and easy. Just sometimes extremely repetitive. I appreciate the idea this pounds the language into your head, but I feel like true immersion involves a broader use of the language than the same statements over and over and over. It would also be far more enjoyable and less drudgery, to log in and expect to learn something new instead of dreading saying the same 5 things repeatedly.', ""It is fun but I keep getting told that it is not a way to completely learn to be fluent. I am addicted to it. I like congratulating others to keep at it. I both like it and sometimes don't like it when they add changes. I got all the way to the second checkpoint when they determined that the second check point I was at should not be there anymore. It was very upsetting. I also kept the minimum amount for my streak to continue because I'm a mom and have busy distractions."", 'Huge fan. But PLEASE fix the way the program freezes, never to unfreeze. I am having to uninstall and reinstall constantly. This is a fabulous program. I am grateful because I have learned a lot from you. Update -- SIX months have passed. The screen freeze issue remains together with the need to uninstall and reinstall to get it working again.

This is frustrating, especially when even an adult can't hear it and then she spells it wrong WITH help! Often the beginning or ending consonant is so soft that it cannot be heard at all, even with the volume up to maximum. The volume level also fluctuates a bit from activity to activity. We have been using this for a few weeks and have seen progress already. Will keep using, but hope the pronunciation improves."", ""My daughter loves reading eggs, math seeds and fast phonics. Reading eggs has helped her immensely to learn to read and with the addition of fast phonics, it has helped her to improve her pronunciation. The biggest problem I have is with the app itself. After she completes a lesson it sometimes freezes, especially in reading eggs. The only way I've found to fix it is by shutting down the app and restarting it which is frustrating when my daughter is in the middle of something and has to start over. Some of the lessons are a bit repetitive but she hasn't seemed to mind. If the developer could fix the issue with the app freezing up then you would get 5 stars from me."", ""Although I thought the educational content of this game was great, it requires too much manual dexterity. This, not the instruction, was the source of my child's frustration. Many of the interaction points were extremely small. A lot of the time, this was clearly an intentional design choice.

Sound drops constantly making certain lessons unsolvable and very frustrating for the kids who then guess and get things wrong. Logins are complete lottery , with constant failure to login (timeouts ) likely due to server capacity. When it works it's great, but most of the time it's well below expectations despite being a mandated school requirement"", ""One can see a lot of work has gone into this app. People who know properly how to teach reading developed the concept. My daughter really enjoys collecting the eggs by doing the exercises, which are funny and divers. I can also see that her reading has improved. What I don't like are all the distractions within the app. Yes, some games and fun in between are fine. But I think a bit less of this would have been better."", ""This is a great app. The activities are diverse and based on strong literacy learning principles. My 5-year-old loves it, and he recognizes that it is helping him learn. It also helps him control impulses as he has to listen or think before clicking (well, he's working on it).We have to close it and restart it a lot. I still really recommend it.

Curriculum is great, program has problems."", ""I would give it 5 stars if it didn't keep freezing and crashing all the time! My son is 2 and I decided to introduce him to an app to stimulate his mind. He always asks to play on it but it always freezes and gets stuck on the loading screen and I have to keep logging out and back in again. I'm only on the free trial at the minute so won't be paying for it if its going to keep freezing and crashing all the time."", 'Great app but freezes alot which is frustrating for my 7 year old daughter. The app freezes so we have to keep closing the app to move into the next lesson. My daughter loses interest as it happens a few times during her Reading Eggs sessions. If the issue is sorted, it would be incredible, she would be able to focus and concentrate more on her lessons. Otherwise a great app for learning.', ""My almost 4 year old begs to use this every day. He has come on leaps and bounds, he genuinely enjoys the challenges and gets so excited when it's time for a new egg to hatch, a quiz, a new certificate. Our only issue is that some of the cut scenes freeze his tablet and we have to close and re-enter the app to carry on, it only adds maybe 20 seconds when it happens but it's a nuisance. But that may be down to the tablet rather than the app. Overall, a firm favourite that I'm happy to pay for!"", ""The game is a fabulous program of reading and math. But the free version is full of bugs, constantly freezes itself and my phone. Very frustrating for my 4 year old and me! That's why 2 stars. UPDATE : I got a free trial option so reinstalled it. I click play on FAST PHONICS, choose the level, then a blue screen appears and doesnt go away. I have to shut the game and restart. My tech specs are fine. I was considering buying the mthly subscription but am hesitant now."", ""I would love to give a higher rating however the constant freezing is ridiculous. I've contacted support but instead of admitting the app has issues they told me the tablet probably didn't meet specifications. I had confirmed that it was well within all specifications before even contacting support. The program is wonderful but we have barely been able to use it recently. We have the most recent update yet it still froze 6 times in 10 minutes. Please do something about this."", ""Signed up originally for the 30 day free trial. It is a good tool, albeit a little too repetitive. However as the many other reviews have also said, it constantly freezes! You have to shut it down and reopen and hope you haven't lost your level progress!! We have access on several up-to-date devices with stable internet connection and the issue continues. For the premium subscription I'd expect better to be honest. Will be cancelling at the end of the free trial unfortunately due to this."", ""Some of the content is great, if you can get to it. The navigation is awful - it's unclear what all the different categories represent, and everything takes AGES to load. Also, every time we try to get to the lessons my daughter has to retake the placement test. We've tried the same test three times this week, and it's very long and INCREDIBLY boring. Presumably this is a bug, but there's about 30 questions, and they're way beyond a six year old's capability - it's upsetting for her"", ""Really like the idea of this app but it is unusable in it's current form with the constant freezing so we will not be subscribing. Hopefully the developers are addressing the issues as the actual program is great, just doesn't work technically. Have checked tech specs and we are way above minimum requirements, there are definitely bugs in the software."", ""I really like the content of this app and it holds my 3 year old's attention for a long time. She learns lots from it as evidenced by her reading outside the app. It is quite buggy though with frequent crashes and glitches and impossible to get through to support. I also think I places it is too sensitive. We work through lessons together but often, especially with the books, if you touch the screen by mistake to point to a letter it registers a wrong answer or it flips the page. Annoying."", ""Reading eggs is a great program and is working well for my daughter but the app has a few problems. The volume is inconsistent so you have to adjust it frequently. The app lags in some activities and freezes at the end of others so you have to restart it a few times each lesson. I'm hoping these issues will be fixed."", ""Highly recommended! Living in a non-English speaking country and struggling with sending the kids to after school English lessons, ReadingEggs is a lifesaver. All my kids love it - (ages 5-9). It's a fantastic program and at every turn keeps on surprising with new features. Only confusion was we thought in the beginning that it had to be an app on an android/ios device and we weren't that thrilled about it but turned out that it doesn't have to be! We find it much much easier to use on PC and we love it!"", 'The program itself is great and my 6 year old and 3 year old both love it. I am currently on the trail version and think we will be doing the monthly subscription, however the app constantly freezes, showing a big black screen while the audio continues. Our device meets the specifications so I have no clue why this happens. Both on the app and the website (yes, while using the latest version of chrome). Please fix ASAP. I also think the app title should have mathseeds in it.', ""Both my 5 year old and my 6 year old love Maths Seeds, Fast Phonics and Reading Eggs. Some of the games can drag on a bit and these lose interest (I realise the importance of repetition but sometimes it's a fine line between that and boredom) but, for the most part, this is an excellent resource. Definitely the best one we've tried and we've subscribed for another year without hesitation."", ""The app itself is fantastic and I can't recommed it enough to help phonic and reading development. My little one really struggled until we signed up and since then, has complete soared through and doesnt grimmace at the sight of words. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because of the constant freezing and crashing recently, which has started to put my little one off using it."", ""Great when it works, but as more people seem to be finding, it just doesn't work very well once you get out of Reading Eggs Junior. It's a technically undemanding app, but crashes and hangs all the time. As a piece of advice re customer service, perhaps take some time to look at your coding instead of blaming the power of people's devices (of which ours meets the requirements). There are problems with the app, take that onboard before it really starts to impact your business."", 'As a mother of a 5 year old and a 3 year old, and as an English teacher, I cannot recommend this app highly enough. We have steered clear of apps and tablets for our girls, however when I discovered this app, and after a successful free trial, we allow both of them set time with supervision, and both are excelling in their literacy skills. Our 3 year old is sounding out, blending, knowing words by sight (rapidly catching up with her sister who is in school), and both girls really enjoy the app.', ""My child literally LOVES Reading Eggs. She was looking for something to get her reading / spelling skills up, so I looked into this. Me, being a responsible parent, downloaded it for her to try for some days. She enjoyed it, so I started to pay the $15 each month. Her favourite part is learning, and MY favourite part is.. THERE'S NO ADS! No distractions from my child learning. Great app, keep it up."", ""It's a great app and my kids are showing some good learning developments. One little annoying thing though : volume level fluctuates a lot. i.e. lessons start with low voice and go up suddenly. First 10-20 seconds of the lessons are usually quieter. This need a constant controlling of the device volume. Would be great if you could fix it"", ""It's a good app, however I'm experiencing the same issues that another reviewer has mentioned. The app crashes a lot, and freezes on between learning activities. Some times you can here the audio instruction playing but the screen has not moved on the the correct page. It freezes at the end of certain tasks. It is not my device or internet connection that is causing this. I have to go to setting and close the app every time it cracked and restart the app."", ""I found the app is missing allot of vital stuff. My number one is when the child gets something wrong you just play a sound , so it doesn't show what they did wrong instead of 'if the child has to choose mmm and they choose the letter c you need to play the phonics so they know the difference instead of a sound. If that makes sense, it just small buts that makes a whole lot of difference and turns a mistake into a sort of subliminal learning."", ""Just finished a 30 day trial. My 2.5 year old loves the games and was able to work out how to do most of them with a little guidance. I am not entirely happy with our experience however as the app would frequently freeze meaning we need to close it down and start fresh. Sometimes losing progress in a game. I don't believe it's worth the monthly fee with its current issues and so will not be subscribing."", ""This has been excellent for my son who I'm home-schooling. Loads to do on there and I love the progress report and emails on what he has achieved and what he needs work with. Also the print off bonus material is so helpful. It does take some time to get the hang but worth it!"", ""Daughters really love this and always want to go on it which is great as they are learning so many reading skills without knowing! :) But there are a few letter sounds pronounced incorrect which isnt helpful i.e they pronounce the P grapheme 'puh'. Also my youngest cant do it by herself yet as you can only get three goes wrong before having to start again. It would be good if there was an easier setting for her (she's 3). Another thing we find is the books are read out by the man way too fast!"", ""The site is cumbersome, uninspired and the graphics are BORING! (This is coming from a person that misses the old atari games - I'm not fussy with graphics lol) We had to skip exercises because it was difficult to navigate and the volume was either woeful or blasting None of my 3 kids learned to read from it, they enjoyed it mostly but I bought it to teach them, not as a game. The site needs to be updated instead of milked for profit. There are far better programs out there"", 'Fantastic learning through play app for phonics and reading. Started when little one was 4.5yo, went through first couple maps then got stuck, came back 6months later. Overall content are really motivating and enjoyable. Lots of repetition to cement the new learning but through wide range of different ""game"" style learning activities. We have trie other ready apps, this is by far the best. No issues on Andriod mobile device and iPad.', 'Absolutely brilliant program. I saw my daughter at the age of 4, reading better than kids that are 7 or 8. Thanks to reading eggs, right before my eyes. Amazing. Worth every cent. It\'s almost bad parenting, i.e. You don\'t have to do anything, and your child learns to read. It\'s amazing. We started maths seeds now, and by default she is powering through the lessons. When your kid yells out for your phone because she ""wants to do learning!"" (in her exact words), what more can you do but give?', 'The app is being utilised by my 8 year old daughter, it was recommended by her school and they use it to keep track of progress. The app crashes, forcing her to repeat the same level over and over again. It also freezes while she is using it. Please fix the bugs because I see it is a common problem that evidently leads to your 3.3 rating.', 'Installed and started off great. 4 year old was doing activity of recognising Letter M. But, my son moved onto the next letter/activity after about 5 minutes and then suddenly the whole game/app froze. Restarted and tried it again... froze in the same place. Tried it one more time and it did the same thing. Both son and I got frustrated.

The courses and the instructors were excellent. My problem is this now, I got a new phone and a chromebook and am unable to download and open the course on either device. I am still able to access the app and courses on my PC, but, not on the aforementioned, new devices that would allow me to access my courses and materials on the go.', ""My experience has been excellent so far. I've had one lesson, and I liked the easy interface of the app. I learned about the myriad of tools that Photoshop has to offer, and I'm anticipating what skills I will acquire by the end of the class.

If the issue gets fixed, then I would be happy to change it back to five stars."", 'courses are easy to schedule. instructors are knowledgeable, very well prepared and break the information down into the need to know. The fitness courses tell the straight truth in regards to weight loss and getting in shape. great for anyone, instructors give a very good foundation for beginners. and the information is a great refresher for advanced. Highly recommended', ""I've now completed 3 lessons in the initial 28-day free trial period. The lessons are clear, step by step, well illustrated and organized, and I've already learned a great deal. I'd hoped for the ability to be more interactive, and it would be nice to be able to ask questions on the site AFTER a lesson is finished (issues arise when I attempt to apply what I've just learned). There also seem to be some technical glitches, both on my PC & the app. Over all though, I'm very pleased- will continue!"", ""So far a great experience. I love the concept of setting up the course with designated class times. The tool kit is a great reaource in addition to the ability to view previously recorded classes. I look forward tolearning my new skill & putting it to use. Downside, as everyone has mentioned, it is going to cost you a substantial amount to get the additional resources but what's that to being able to turn your skill into a business? You have to invest at some point. Also, way too many emails."", 'Pretty good for what it is. I enrolled in the Graphic Design program and I had my first lesson. I\'ve been to a private art school for a degree (never finished) and this seems to be giving the same information, except in a more diluted form. The thing I have the biggest issue with is the constant emails and urging you to get a toolkit. If you\'re paying (I\'m using the 30 day free trial), shouldn\'t you automatically get that? Or maybe get a decent discount. Paying $40 per module (which only has 2 lessons!) on top of a monthly subscription seems like quite a bit. And then also having to pay to get your certificate/""diploma"" is a bit ridiculous as well for a subscription-based learning app.', ""The content is excellent and I love that you can watch the recordings after attending the class so that you can go back and see anything you might have missed. The only thing that I didn't like was how much you got spammed by pop ups asking you to buy toolkits and hard copy diplomas. It made the site/app hard to navigate on your phone because it took up a decent size of the screen and never seemed to go away even after hitting the X button. That being said, I stuck with it because the content was great and the instructors were very knowledgable and easy to follow."", 'Firstly, I just completed the first lesson, which was pretty informative. I did not like that I could not pause during the lesson time. However, after the lesson was over, you can listen to the recording where it allows you to pause. I cannot be certain how well the course is from one lesson, but going off the first lesson I will at least continue till the end of the module. Secondly, I also find it annoying when they keep trying to get you to buy the toolkit when I keep rejecting the offer. Lastly, when the lesson is completed you are supposed to be able to complete a quiz and turn in your assignment, but they are both locked. From my understanding, the lessons should take an hour, mainly 30 minutes of information and the other should be spent completing the assignments. If the assignments are not going to be open then it just wastes your time. Overall, I would recommend trying out the course before committing, everyone learns differently.', ""I'm really enjoying the app so far and learning a lot. My only issue is with the large amount of pop up adds and emails, and the fact there's no option to pause the class. I'm a mother to two boys who I'm homeschooling so I need the option to be able to pause the video lessons instead of just going back after the class and rewatching the whole thing. Other than that I've had no issues so far and I'm excited to continue my courses."", ""Good app when you're computers not handy, but there are a few things that would make it so much better. I'll text support specifics on the issues I'm running into with the app. Getting less user friendly all the time! Now they've taken away the ability to download recorded lessons so you can study off-line. Too bad! That was one of the best features of this app....."", ""Missed my first class because of a player error on Chrome and edge. Tried this app and it didn't work either. I finally tried Chrome on my phone and it worked... After I missed the first quarter of the lesson. Not a good first impression. And the only support option I saw was an ai bot. Oh and God forbid you get a phone call during the session. Plus it says the recording is now available since I missed most of it due to technical issues, but of course it's not. Unbelievable."", ""The course is fast paced, but good! Just watch and try to take a few mental notes then go back and watch the recordings and practice. Initially misleading, as the course is NOT free, although it is low cost. So, say it is cheap because it ISN'T free. It is often difficult to sign into the lessons and the 3 family members that I added either didn't get to login or were being asked to pay, although I already paid. Something on the site is always asking for some payment which is frustrating!"", ""Pretty user friendly. Don't like how everything cost money and how they bring it up every class, I understand that is where they get their money during free trials, but its sort of obnoxious. There is a lot of great information and it is improving my knowledge on nutrition a lot. I plan to cancel the subscription after the classes are finished but sounds like that will be a task based off other reviews."", ""I want to focus on the overall learning experience and the user interface of the app/program. I'm giving it a 4 star because I get at least 5 emails a day regarding my classes (the more classes you have the more emails you will get). But other than that I've learned so much, it is super convenient and easy to work with. I've looked into many different schools and this was the best option for my super busy life. I personally took graphic design and illustration and I'm super satisfied."", 'I really like the content a lot. The overall experience so far does a lot to diminish my enthusiasm, however. So much spam! Reminders of class schedules are one thing and, of course, the occasional offer to purchase additional courses and materials at a discount. I\'m still in my ""free"" trial and, between that and a lot of the other reviews, I\'m frankly on the fence as to whether I will continue with Shaw (assuming that I am allowed to even cancel without a lot of drama). Too bad! My first week I was in heaven at finding such a great resource to pursue a long time interest. Now? Purgatory at best. Maybe an a la carte option?', 'Not only do you pay a monthly subscription fee but you pay for class materials as well it is quite a racket they have going. On top of that you are inundated with messages through email and text about EVERYTHING!!!! I easily got at 6 - 7 emails and another 6 -7 texts each and every single day. Plus the app set notifications as well. The information in the classes were just not worth the hassle.', ""I just did my first lesson. It was a little fast for me but having the ability to go back after its done and rewatch it and pause where I need to to take notes (because yes I'm a note taker) was very helpful. I agree with a couple of the other reviews that there is an over abundance of notifications about the class, but over all I am very happy with my experience and look forward to more lessons."", 'Promising app! Content is organized, relevant, nicely presented, and detailed. Room for improvement: Navigation is cumbersome at first, not quite intuitive. There are editing errors in the quizzes and assignments. The plethora of emails, texts, and app notifications is enough to stress a person out. Many could be combined into just one. I am really excited to see this app grow and expand. Once the quirks are attended to, it will be a fantastic way to keep minds active, growing, and engaged!', 'More of a hassle. I was interested in some of the course options. I signed up for the free 4 week trial. I attempted to cancel 3 days into the free trial, it took a survey, multiple questions, and still was directed to call in. Two months later I was charged $69.99 for a service I thought was canceled and never accessed the content. And still am being pushed around about getting my refund.', ""there's some bugs in the app sometime when you download the course but it won't let me watch it and view it offline. the information is great, but it is also hard to reschedule or figure out how to get a better time for certain courses. for example when you sign up for a class you can pick two days and a Time but if something happens and you need to change it and it's very hard to do so through the app. Or trying to reschedule for the same course after taking it before is also difficult."", 'The courses are informative and eye opening but, the bad thing is that the instructor goes really quickly and you cannot pause or stop the session. When the class is done, they say you can ""re-watch"" the session but that is not the case. I tried doing that because I missed some important notes, but it never let me re watch anything. Please fix that, everyone has different learning styles and paces!', ""App is pretty useful as you can attend classes/videos from your phone, although changing class times and your schedule could be made easier as I have run into some technical issues of changing the class schedule times. Also I wish I didn't receive a million notifications and emails and text all the time trying to sell me stuff or updates- it is a bit of overkill. 'Ad blindness' comes to mind, a term I recently learned while doing the Digital Marketing course on here... As for the content- I have only completed my first week of classes for two courses I am doing. So far it has been decently informative and helpful, although sometimes the classes come off more as recordings than interactive courses. Also for one of my classes I had a different 'instructor' on the second lesson and I would of liked to keep the one I had in the first lesson to have some consistency. Otherwise I am thrilled to start learning on these courses. I am curious to see if they will compare better to other online courses as there are many many options out there."", 'So far so good. I will update this as a I go along, the classes have been very informative and I do feel some progress happening. I am concerned about their one click purchase. If you click it, it has been bought. There are no prompts or anything, including accidental clicks or taps. Their layout is nice but still needs major work. The countdown for the next class on your dashboard will be hard to read as it gets squished together. There are some errors on the website that are mostly visual...', ""Took a graphic design course. Good info and instruction but I'm not a beginner and there didn't seem to be a way to skip to more advanced lessons without watching all the beginner ones. I rescheduled each class so that they were one right after the other so I could go back and watch the recording and speed up the videos. Lots of marketing emails. Canceling is a hassle. You have to call in. They try to extend your trial and other things to keep you subscribed so you have to be firm to cancel."", 'So far this has been very informative. There are too many notifications, (at least 10 notifications on lesson days), some notifications are even sent twice via the same media, and it really pushes the purchase of the toolkit, etc. but has been giving me a great deal of useful information. It would be nice to be able to pause the lessons the first time through, in case of a phone call, or a bathroom break. Promised things that were never delivered on. (Free kit for rating for one.)', ""This app seems to function well for the purposes. The courses themselves are still being explored but seem to provide good information thus far. My instructor's presentation sounds like she is reading from a script, and her script is as if she is talking to us live, but there is no actual interaction so it seems to me to be prerecorded. That's a little weird, but the information itself is good."", 'This app sends way too many notifications. And they are mostly to say ""you\'ve missed a class, reschedule"", even though I was in the class. Occasionally, my classes will also disappear from my class list, too. I\'ve been very happy with how the courses are taught and the amount of information given in them, but the constant bombardment is a bit much, and the phone calls are extremely unnecessary.', 'I just completed the first lesson in the bookkeeping course. The content was interesting. There was something off about the size of the video, and I felt the video went too fast to ask quesions. But, I was able to replay the video at my own speed afterwards, and was able to take good notes. I am looking forward to the remainder of the lessons!', 'So far the courses are on point and have helpful information. The user interface is easy, however I have had a difficult time finding exactly where to click to view on a desktop. Sometimes I run late and get messages that I missed the class. I also get annoyed with the amount of reminders that keep coming on email and text. It over the top. Especially since I signed up for 4 concurrent classes. These could be consolidated into a daily single message? I would also like to view 2 classes in a row on the same day but have to jump through the scheduling hoops to make that happen. The music classes are like that. Learn the skills, the go to the practical application immediately.', ""Great information and courses, although the bot that answers the questions on the side of a class could be more helpful. The pricing is pretty cheap but I found it through an advertisement that told me I'd be taking a free course and then immediately was taken to a page to pay for course materials. These minor issues aside, the professor for Graphic Design seems very knowledgeable and with a kind demeanor. The slides that play during class are also very helpful!"", 'I was extremely excited to dive into learning more about data analysis but this course is disappointing at best. The additional packet of information they charge for is NOT worth the purchase. It contains nothing more than the word-for-word script used during ""class"". I was really hoping for additional information to help me learn. The examples are not easy to follow, as they leave out important steps (I assume they think you already know some of this stuff). I was disappointed to learn I could not get a refund, instead they gave me access to another course. Well, the 1st wasn\'t easy to navigate, not really sure how much better or useful taking another course would be.', 'Very misleading. Was very interested until the immediate ""purchase course materials"" popped up for $40 along with several other ""optional"" purchases that seemed essential. The whole point in starting the trial was the fact it was free. If your faced with obstacles that will not allow you to properly take part in the course unless you make a purchase, why do you advertise it as ""free""? Further more, after reading comments that others have left, I\'m wondering if in fact I will be charged anyway.', ""I wanted to do my first class on my laptop but it would never load from the dashboard. When it finally did load it wouldn't let me join the class already in progress (30 seconds). Ended up doing it on my phone. Disappointed it wouldn't let me rotate the screen so it was bigger. I will watch the replay to be sure I didn't miss anything. The actual content and pace seem good."", ""The course looks as if it will be fun and interesting. But I'm very disappointed that it appears the lessons are not kept up to date. In my first lesson there are 2 recommended software downloads. One has been discontinued and the other has quite a few newer versions available from what is listed in the lesson. I'm not sure which version I should download if any and I don't know a replacement for the discontinued one. No support on weekends is another disappointment."", 'Full of advertising! They offer a free class but require you to buy the ""toolkit"" and the diploma for 40 bucks each. I attended my first class (watched a video) and the interaction piece was super annoying and unhelpful. I know a fair amount about nutrition, and I wasn\'t sure if I\'d learn anything. I did pick up one small interesting fact that I didn\'t know before. I\'ll try a few more classes. They really go all out trying to make sure you engage, sending many reminders on EVERY platform...', ""The instruction and content are solid so far. Although the first 4 weeks are free (that's just for module 1 of 4 - fair enough), you are asked for your credit card right away. So, be careful about pop-ups and 'single click' buttons. The platform constantly tries to up-sell class notes, etc., all at a click of a button. If you're not paying attention, it's easy to spend $40 straight away."", ""Attempted several times to cancel subscription before I was charged seeing that the platform isn't as helpful as it could be. I call to cancel and the automated system sent me through the same list of options several times with no option to speak to a person and my account was still charged, though I was never even able to attend a full class. I am very disappointed at the tedious nature of the cancelation process."", ""I got a 4 week course thru T-Mobile, used it to take an Excel class. Very helpful, like the fact that I can go back and watch the lessons at a later time if I want. The things I don't like - everytime you open the app it tries to get you to buy something, put a card on file, etc. Also, even though I attend the class - I get messages saying I missed the class, etc"", ""I definitely give a 5 star rating for the courses as they are very detailed informative and helping with my personal growth as well as my lone of work. It's the ongoing system issues that is driving me up the wall. The app is not working for me all I get is a blank scene with a blue circle loading in the middle of the screen but nothing loads just keeps spinning. Some courses I should have completed already but all I get is coming soon the entire module 4."", 'I like the app because I can use it on my computer or phone. It is easy to access, downloading was quick and easy. I chose the Graphic Design on a Budget course because I am starting a digital downloads store and with free lessons to start, it is just what I needed. The lessons are great, the teacher is helpful, goes over the classwork and there is lessons to download and follow along with the class (you have to pay for the toolkit but that gives you the lessons, extra videos, and bonus content).

It was working prefect until about 2 weeks ago, most likely around the time the schools closed. The messages tab is not loading, it loads when it feels like it. I have 2 different accounts and when I toggle from one account to the other it won't load the entire profile. This makes it difficult to send and receive messages from teachers. The notifications tab keeps showing new alerts even though I've seen the messages multiple times, it won't clear the alerts."", ""I really really really need there to be notifications for when the teacher assigns things, because our class discussions sometimes correspond with Dojo prompts, but sometimes they don't, and because of this, I am always accidentally missing assignments!

Bought the life time VIP subscription. But please add a dark mode if possible. *Edit* after using this app for a while i noticed following drawbacks: Example sentences are very tiny. Makes it very difficult to write them down (even when using the large font size). Because there is no dark mode, almost the entire screen is white, making it difficult on the eyes for prolonged uses and also drains the battery of my phone fairly quickly.', ""It's ok. Wish there was an option to reset my progress, I haven't studied for a few months and would like to start from scratch. It's not convenient to review, and, even though you forgot 1/3, have all scores still on 100% from last time. I also wish there was a translation and pronunciation of each word after selecting the answer."", 'The best app to learn Chinese. Totally recommend it. The only thing I would have liked in the app is a ""Stroke training"" for characters. Remembering all the characters are hard, an exercise/training only for the strokes would be great and very helpful. Also adding some grammar lessons would also be very helpful. Nonetheless, it is one of the best app, if not the best app to learn Chinese.', 'It really helps me a lot for my exam. This app is friendly to use.The categories are well organised and the lessons are easy to understand. I hope this app to add HSKK for more speaking practice.', 'It is a cool app to check your chinese level although all features are unlocked with the membership you can still enjoy a lot of things', 'Even if you\'ve already purchased the subscription to be able to use the app, you can\'t do anything unless you purchase VIP for a rediculous fee (even with ""71% off""!). I was using it fine and the content is good. Now there\'s a Chinese new year offer which I can\'t get passed or close, so I cant continue using the app. Very frustrating as this is the official app and I wouldn\'t expect this from an official exam body..', ""UPDATE: I already can purchase the VIP. Thank you for the response. I can't purchase VIP Using Google Play Balance. I'm in Indonesia. Please fix it and I will add more stars to the review."", 'In this app one can find stuff for reading as well as writing which I was never able to find in other apps. But it would be great if the app could have the option for downloading the lessons as it is very helpful in the areas were network is unstable.', 'This is a good app for HSK practice, it has lots of content for reading and listening practice, which is very hard to find elsewhere. However it\'s also quite buggy, it gets stuck on ""loading"" a lot or doesn\'t update progress for a long time. Worth the $30 lifetime membership but needs work.', ""It's a great app for learning mandarin, you have words with example sentences for every HSK level, some exercises and a past HSK test for free. The only problem I have with this app is that it starts up automatically. I close the process and then a few minutes later it's working again"", ""Like a more advanced but less polished Duolingo. More legitimate tests. Audio tests are incredibly difficult. Interface and UX is kinda bad. Also seems like you basically need to spend the money, it unlocks VIP tests if you want access to the proper HSK tests. Not sure if it's worth it yet though. Frankly, it seems a bit janky."", 'To easy to accidentally skip a question without being able to return. Great app for the rest', 'App does not work. Please reply with a contact email so I can use the app. Thanks.', 'I really enjoy using this app. I get a lot of listening practice, which is the area I struggle with the most. They help you understand why you got the answer wrong. The app is well organized and easy to follow. I would choose this over any other hsk preparation or chinese learning app! So useful!', 'Ahahah. 5 minutes per day or pay $20. Useless app.', 'I am using a 10 inch tablet but the text is still very small and the characters are quite difficult to see. I would also like more pinyin used so I do not have to turn to other apps for a more thorough translation. I would have expected this on a paid version.', 'This is a great app. I still find Hello Chinese better for practice because of the review and flashcards and stuff, but this is helpful too in expanding vocabulary and being able to master the HSK levels which should help significantly in grasping the language. I also think it\'s hilarious that it asked me to leave a review.. to say no you have to click on ""refuse cruelly"" 😂, I think that\'s my favorite thing about the app right now.', 'Best app for advance learners. I live in china and my level is quite advanced (hsk4 almost), so other apps duolingo, busuu only cover basic chinese and i felt i need something easy for me to continue learning, so this app is great, yes the audios and text are advanced but is perfect tool for people who dont have the time to seat for hours to study, with this app i can study at work, metro, bathroom, lunch time wherever. I pass hsk3 due to the app and now preparing for hsk4', ""I really liked the app and the curriculum. Even though as a free user I can only use it for five mins a day. However I'm unable to pass the special listening (true/false) in unit 1 because the interface freezes. Have filed a complaint from the app many times but it's not been fixed. Pls check asap."", 'Such a good job! This app provides different ways to approach with chinese language, It is the first time I have found an app to study chinese so efficiently. In fact you can exercise on different hsk levels : not only listening and reading but also lists of words with the possibility of writing them to learn the character in a better way.', 'I love this app. After you buy one of the subscriptions you get access to all the lessons and they add you to one of their hsk groups where you can ask questions. They also post quizzes regularly. There are reading and listening exercises as well as vocabulary with example sentences. The vocabulary is grouped into smaller sections so that when you finish a group you feel so accomplished. This app helped me improve my listening skills better than proper classes in school.', ""It's good. It has comprehensive vocab memorising unit and good listening and reading parts which explain vocab. Some translations into English are a bit dodgy or sometimes explanations can be misleading. Otherwise great app that will help you pass the exam and/or improve your Chinese"", 'This app is great, love the exercises , they help you understand and remember the words in a fun, easy and practic way. I simply love it, it s a great tool to practice new words and understand their meaning. Highly recommend it.', ""It's very good, but the free part is too limited. So unless you pay you will get tired of repeated questions after 30 minutes. I mean the 聽力 exercises, etc. At least, that was my experience checking HSK5 level."", 'Have to agree with other reviews, that they arejust trying to get more money from old lifetime VIPs(such as myself). If you bring up the issue that you already are VIP, they will send you standardized answer that this is new part of the app and hence not included. So even if you purchase lifetime VIP now, you can be sure they will pull the same stunt in the future. I would understand, if they would offer cheap upgrade for the extra features, but they demand full price! So beware!', ""I paid for the lifetime VIP access but then they 'upgraded' the app and suddenly I'm not VIP anymore. I have to pay more for content I used to access with my lifetime subscription. In other words don't pay for this app as they can arbitrarily remove your rights at any time, it's a scam."", 'Incredible app. Exactly what I was looking for to prepare/study for the HSK. It allows me to search and save the characters I want to learn, hear the pronunciations, hear it in a sentence, see an animated stroke order and then practice it! Fantasic, definitely download this app', ""I've used the free version for a while now and it's a solid way to practice vocabulary, organized by level. There are other test prep features too but I'm happy to just have the basics."", ""Please kindly provide dark mode and rotation to landscape feature when being used in tablet (iPad). Sometimes the sound couldn't be played and or even get stuck during practice, hence, I need to close the app and redo them."", 'I think using this app helps me get the vocabulary necessary to speak Chinese easier. Also, the app divide the learning process of the language in a way that, in my opinion, makes it more fluidly. I have to say that I appreciate all the tools it provides.']","['org.sinamon.duchinese', 'com.chineseskill', 'com.deer.cc', 'com.hellochinese', 'com.chinesegrammar']",https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hskonline&hl=en&gl=us
