Therfore, I request to the concerned authorities to resolve the problem asap so that I can continue with my classes with ease."", ""This is not an ideal app for a student, not because it does not provide all the necessary tools to attend any class or any other function.

The video is always strucking even if both the students and teacher have a proper net connection. To schools who are thinking about this app as your preference just wipe it off.

The volume is very low relative to the overall media volume, so when I swich apps or a driving alert happens, those are incredibly lound because I have the volume turned up all the way for this app. The app does not stop playing when you turn off your car or remove the headphones. The app starts playing as soon as it is opened, which can be awkward. The app contines to play even after it is closed with no way to control the volume.

For example, after using Pluralsight for a while, performance really starts to slow down.

Another example: Earlier today, I paused playback on a course, came back several hours later, and Chromecast w/ Google TV had booted to recovery screen with messaging about an unstable application. I\'ve never experienced this behavior with any other application so I\'m pretty sure it\'s Pluralsight. I hope these issues can get fixed. I really enjoy being able to watch Pluralsight courses from the comfort of my sofa.', ""I've tried to learn from Pluralsight in the past and just didnt care enough to go past skin deep. 3 years later. They have had added all sorts of courses & quizzes to help you learn more about your craft. I am now very eager to jump in and learn more. Way better then skillshare, udemy and other online courses. Give it a try!"", ""I love PluralSight, but the only time I use this app is to watch on my Chromecast, and I've found this experience to be unusable at times. It's been this way ever since I started using the app about 6 months ago. Some of the issues I've had: 1) Videos will randomly crash to the pluralsight title screen, 2) clips randomly restarting from beginning, 3) videos automatically restart on my phone once I stop casting"", ""[Update 2021-05-09: critical issues not fixed almost 2 years later. Dropping down to 1.] App is super buggy, detracts from learning. Very often, the course content screen will go black. Sometimes you can't stop or pause the course, and the audio keeps playing even if you close the app. Whenever these glitches happen, you have to navigate deep into Settings, find the app, and do Force Close. The app is also inconsistent in helping you resume your course when resuming."", ""The content is great. The app needs work. I couldn't get the media controls (play, pause, etc) panel to go away nor the course title banner so much of the view is hidden. Some panels won't go away once you use them. Feels like a wrapped desktop browser app that expects desktop events (e.g. mouse clicks) for some behavior triggers."", ""Can't cast to Chromecast. The only way I'm able to cast this app is to mirror my entire S7's screen. Would love to be able to cast the app successfully to my TV. I use Chromecast everyday with other apps & no issues. When casting with this, only the Pluralsight logo appears on the screen, no audio, and play/pause buttons are nonresponsive."", ""A fully functional mobile app is essential. With this app, I've experienced poor video playback, failed downloads, loosing my place in videos. This is not what I would expect in this flourishing market. Regarding content, Pluralsight makes it seem like there is a vast number of courses to choose from. The reality is, Pluralsight's competitors have much more. Perhaps it is all there and I am unable to find it in the app? I expected much more. Update: Don't be fooled by the false positive reviews."", ""Videos suddenly freeze at times and refuse to continue playing until restarting the app. Videos sometimes crash on the website as well, but it's much more annoying in the app since it usually means re-opening it and attempting to resume the course. Full screen mode is buggy and won't hide the navigation bar if you dismiss the app update message. Also, background play likes to remain active at times after closing the app and force closing the app is necessary to get rid of it."", 'App is very broken on Andriod 10. Vids continue to play even when the app is closed or back button. Chronological and seqential ordering of modules is broken (downloaded content). Good spectrum of material and normally recent content and material. Can download modules. Wish it would let you select an entire course instead of each module individually. Good source of IT training vids. Would recommend.', ""Pluralsight is by far the best self learning tool for software developers that is out there. This Android app delivers the content any very easy to consume manner. Does exactly what it needs to do and provides all the functionality I need. I've been using Pluralsight for almost 10 years now and couldn't be where I am today in my career without it."", ""I don't quite get it, when I access pluralsight via browser it works fine and videos plays fine but when I access pluralsight through this app, It's slow, I mean loading of courses, fetching videos are so slow, and my progress does not sync with my progress from the browser. I use a fairly capable phone ( huawei Y9 2019) , I dont believe my phone doesn't have the horse power to run this app nor my wifi connection is slow because I ran the browser version and the app version on the same device"", 'Seems to be a major bug while searching for courses. To reproduce: 1. Search courses by topic 2. Scroll through the list 3. Bookmark courses 4. Bug - List will disappear, after a while it will reappear again will lost its last scroll position making the searching experience very frustrating. This happens consistently on a pixel 3a with Android 10, and Galaxy Tablet-A with android 7 Will update review once bug is fixed. Thanks', ""Like most apps, this is a major disappointment compared to the website. I don't see an option for CC and the app didn't appear to know where I left off when I was using the website. Also, somehow I backed out from the video but I was still able listen while browsing other courses which I thought was great but then I couldn't find a way to get back to the video I was listening to."", 'Pluralsight has helped be tremendously in my career. The service is great, but the app is trash. The video player is bad. Continues to play the videos even when minimized. Shows the navbar and notification bar most of the time, even in full screen mode. Unnecessary items in the bottom navbar. Why put ""browse"" and ""search"", when search can be a feature on the browse page. Replace ""search"" with ""profile"" in the bottom navbar.', ""Make the player more customizable with the settings more consistent across devices. I'd like to turn off auto play next video and slow down speed only a little bit like in the browser app. Speed 0.75 is way too slow, I like to listen at 0.9. Also, I hate when it goes to the next video, it is automatically marked as watched. Next time I don't remember, have I watched it whole or not."", 'Outstanding learning platform! It has been my favorite place to gather knowledge for years now. The actual mobile application is very handy and effective. I like the ability to predownload a course to save bandwidth on the go. You can switch between video and audio only depending on your needs.', ""Closing a video is confusing and shaky, not sure if the current video was closed or only minimised. When I close a video I don't want it to run anymore in the background, or suddenly I hear after even closing the whole app!"", 'After using the app for one day, I connected my headphones and it started showing message with error due to internet connection, but my internet connection works perfectly. There is an issue with bluetooth headphones and internet connection. After that I disconnected Bluetooth in my cellphone but the app still shows the headphones icon only in this app. I uninstalled the app and installed it again, and it still shows the headphones icon active.', 'I love the fact that my progress is saved and, unlike other video learning apps, I can still listen to the audio with my phone screen off. The courses and instructors are just as outstanding.', 'May be good for learning, but this app is allowing app tracking on your mobile phone. 112 attempts by Google, Adobe, and Segment.io in just 24 hours. I just found this out today. Unacceptable to me for a learning app to sell or otherwise divulge my personal info to anybody out there. Out of all my apps, Pluralsight has the highest count of tracking attempts.', 'Fantastic. Great resource to keep yourself updated. Has some really good authors. Pluralsight has really taken online learning to a whole different level.', 'When will you fix an error occurred while trying to play the next video error? One year have passed I still have this error popping up almost in all videos', ""One of the best UX, it can cast to a device keeping up your custom config from playback speed and captions, feature that others (LinkedIn and O'Reilly's) learning apps don't."", 'helpful though the questions asked between sections and full 10 question reviews for the comptia A+ core 1 and core 2 should be raised to reflect actual reviews so 90 questions at the end of a set of cores videos that way it integrates review tests and knowledge is more easily absorbed. As well as in the middle of a set of videos smaller tests are not just 3 questions but 10-15 and change as a real test would. I think all videos would benefit from more questions asked especially on the app.', 'You cannot rely on YouTube for learning anymore where people start with random stories , so pluralsights helps with very professional curated contents on topics. Whatever is there in pluralsight is GOLD !', ""Always says I'm offline. At least for the last month... After that fix video player - it rewinds to the beginning every time I switch to another app."", 'I really enjoy learning new things on pluralsight. You can always find up-to-date courses here. And of course a very user-friendly UI.', 'The application stopped working without a VPN in Ukraine. Incompetent support stuff has no idea why. They were unable to provide any workaround/relief. I have cancelled my subscription.', 'The app has buffering issues when trying to cast it to a TV. Better off just watching it from a browser.', 'An extremely valuable app, helps me learn up to date skills. Keeps me informed and on point, and helps me with pathways to a tech future.', 'Got weird bug where if I use my wifi the app will said internal server error but when I use my mobile Internet it work and I have to swith to mobile internet first before using my wifi very annoying the browser version work fine for both wifi and internet', 'Team, please do not send an update every time I open the app. Please increase the time period between updates or process them in bulk at once.', ""Best Place to Learn Industry standard skills on the go,, The App UI is good,, yeah,, needs a bit tweaks, but, Provides what's its intended for. Home screen page shows history which is really handy feature. Just My profile section isn't that great as the web."", 'Does not work from Ukraine. Browser app constantly forces to pass captcha. No reasonable explanation about this from the support.', 'My journey with pluralsight has been a wonderful experience. Their rich course content has really transformed me from a novice with no prior knowledge of coding to a well rounded web developer. I have also delved in cloud computing. Thanks Pluralsight for everything. You guys rock.', 'Unable to play videos after first 1hr of play , The app keep asking me to wait a moment and try again later . Frustrating.', 'Great.

Here are the problems I and my colleagues are experiencing: 1. Attachments disappear randomly after posting them from the library or my computer. 2. It is extremely slow and often won't allow you to do your next task until you refresh the screen. 3. When grading work, the screen that opens to show a student's work is way to small. These are just a few of the problems! It's very frustrating and hopefully we will move to Google classroom next year!"", ""I really like edmodo. As an app and a as a website. The only thing that is a little weird to me is the screen on both the website and definitely the app. You can't see the whole screen in place like the library and progress report. Even if you F11 your screen to full, you only see one to two students or files at a time and the rest of the screen is blank. I see you guys updated it a lot. Keep updating please."", ""I like that you can make groups for students; the quiz options; and that you can upload videos. It's been kicking some of my students out recently (during the pandemic) and they've had to create new accounts to get back in. They should add a calendar feature so kids can select a day and see the work from that specific day. I'd like there to be a way to click to see all the assignments on mobile, rather than scrolling to find an old assignment. Also, the notifications lag."", ""It usually works fine, but I can't seem to block email notifications, and they show up super late (so its basically spamming me) and sometimes Edmodo will crash for several minutes at a time. I'd like to think this has to do with online schooling, but I also hope these issues are able to be updated in future patches. Also, we need a dark mode! Please!! My eyes can't take it!"", 'As a teacher, this app has been a great assistance in connecting with students since the pandemic, I really like it..however , as a Math teacher I like to make corrections on the students actual worksheets , so the option to write/ draw as Microsoft word does not exist on the word document on edmodo. I would love to have that feature included..I realised that many updates has been added recently, and I appreciate them all. Thank you for this.', 'Edmodo was great but recently I stopped receiving notifications of my students messages until days later. This is not helpful to the teacher or student. It is quite disappointing. I hope they are able to fix this issue. I even tried uninstalling and reinstalling but I am still having the same issue.', ""Edmodo is a great app to use. It is easily navigateble and it is very well organized. The only thing that I think that would make it better is if you could see the different comments people make on each post without clicking on the post, but other than that all around it's very helpful and good. Good app, I would recomend it any to anyone any day!"", 'After only a week and a half of using this platform, I have experienced missing test answers on one platform, and a missing assignment on another. This is a terrible blow to my self esteem and has caused me emotional upheaval at a time when I need to feel secure and confident because I was working hard in my class, which is more than I can say of the developers at Edmodo. Horrible! I wish to God that my instructor would spare our college level students the incredible frustration of this platform.', 'There is a plethora of virtual classroom apps now. Edmodo, Google classroom, Microsoft Teams,...blah, blah, blah. They all have their individual strengths and weaknesses. One issue I have with all of them is how well they work across devices and ecosystems. Edmodo is no different in that it is loaded with confusing features, that look and respond differently in android, ios and windows and as a result it is a mess to navigate through and use.', ""I'm a language teacher and I've been using Edmodo for years. It's been working fine until this school year. It glitches a lot, especially when my students need to log in without using Google. I'd still recommend it to people though. It's generally pretty easy to use and I can locate my previous assignments and tests pretty easily from the library."", ""The app does not let you know if the homework that you turned in has been accepted or not. So far, one of the assignments that I turned in is being counted as missing because the teacher changed the due date. I did not know that I had to upload it again. I assumed that I had turned in under the old date, and so it When I signed up, it thought that I was a child. It said that I couldn't have full functionality until I gave my parents' email. I'm 64 years old! Frustrating app."", ""Hard to delete stuff you don't want. Sometimes gives trouble on phones and tablets, especially during tests. Would like to see the assignments that are scheduled for later. Sometimes don't remember scheduling an assignment and there is no visual record for you to check. Now the assign later is not working well as apparently the times are not synchronized. Would like to be able to edit answer grids even after the quiz has been administered. Other than these, great app."", 'It s quite practical for patallel classes and to keep track of STS outside the classroom. However, I hope that developers think of updates.

It does meet my expectations. It shows the lesson, assignment to be done, quiz, etc.', ""Desktop excellent, but App a bit disappointing. What I Finns the most disturbing is that I never receive push notifications although I have ticked most categories in the settings. As a result, I often miss important requests by students. Also, posting an existing assignment from the app is impossible. Finally, it's only possible to attach files from the library one by one, which is very time-consuming. Would be fantastic if you could work on finding these issues. Tia"", 'This is a great application indeed. But yet some features should be developed. As for example, be it from the device, or from the backpack, we cannot select multiple files, or pictures or whatever in a single time. It creates difficulties when we need to attach a lot of files, specially on Android. I hope this problem will be checked.', ""This application is no doubt helpful to anyone either for work or academic related kind of stuff. Just please keep on fixing the technical glitches when students are submitting a quiz, sometimes it shows up 'unanswered' items though all items are already been answered. Also, the popping up of 'notification' is not on time in some cases. P.S. Not sure if the concerns stated were fixed on it's new update, gonna change the rating once I've got a chance to use it in our class and see an improvement."", ""It works. On the website my favorite feature is the backpack, which is something I haven't found on other apps, however, it's not as good in the app. While you can access your backpack in the app, it's impossible (or very hard to find, because I've looked for it) to add or remove stuff from it, and it makes an amazing feature a tad inconvenient. I hope this is fixed, because an otherwise great and unique feature becomes way less useful in the app."", ""It's been great using this app and I love the features. The only issue I have with the app is that my students are not able to view assignments after due date without me reassigning. This happens even when the lock after due date is not turned on. Some students who had done the assignment previously still go ahead to re-do the work. So I'm giving the app a 4⭐."", ""Around the time the familiar blue logo was replaced by the absurdly insignificant new yellow one, important features disappeared, like grade lists. Tests made and used in the past vanished, too, which was greatly frustrating, and it is now inexplicably less simple to add links to posts, or to manage the library. I have also noticed that ads appear on the students' interface. I have started migrating to Google Classroom, and this will definitely be my last year (of many) on Edmodo."", 'Edmodo is easy to set up and start working. It is very helpful to keep all lecture notes, reading materials and assignment instructions. It also facilitates submission and grading of assignments. Last, but not least, it helps to maintain regular interaction with students outside the class. The mobile app is popular with students. The only feature lacking is videoconferencing. Without this feature I might be switching to Google Classrooms next semester.', 'Hello devs! You should really check the submission section. Sometimes, when we upload a document, a photo or something when we click the submit button it appears blank. And some of our teachers where also getting tired of this.

Many people on forums complaining about this, and I've contacted Udemy support - they are doing nothing"", ""I sincerely enjoy Udemy because of the great courses, but after having it for a few years I don't understand why there isn't a dedicated TV app. Chromecast is unstable with Udemy specifically. I can hardly get it to work. It often skips or returns to previous videos. Part of the enjoyment is watching courses on a big screen like you're in a classroom. If they actually manage to change these issues, I will proudly rate the app 5 stars."", ""I love this app for watching and keeping track of my courses BUT the reason i won't give the app 5 stars is because for whatever reason the courses individual lessons get disorganized.

Individual Lessons are numbered My current course shows them in this order Section 1 1, 2, 3, 6, 4, 7, 5, 8 The sad part is even tho they're separated by lessons numbers 6, 7, 8 are part of Section 2 originally"", 'Feb. 24 - after the update, can no longer access all of my courses through the app. When I click ""load more"" in my learning, nothing happens even though I\'ve purchased upwards of 50 courses.

Just displays an error message when trying to cast. The app has been re-installed a few times and the Chromecast was rebooted, every other app I have works fine but this app will not.

Not giving it any more stars though.', ""I've been a user for several years. I love the service: courses are many and inexpensive. The app, however, is a piece of trash not fit to install. It is unresponsive, slow, unwilling to play videos I have downloaded to my phone, and unwilling to save files to the SD card, despite the fact the app allegedly has that ability. I don't know what the people at Udemy are doing but it surely isn't fixing this dumpster fire. They should take a few of their programming courses and fix the app."", ""I like how you can download lectures or whole courses easily to either the SD card or internal memory. Changing the play speed is a great feature - I use it all the time. As my number of courses increases, it's getting harder to manage them. There's simply no way to organize or group courses effectively. This is getting so frustrating, I'm having to drop a star. Also, the app has difficulty playing consistently when my screen turns off or I move between apps."", ""Udemy is an excellent service and company that I am very grateful for (5/5). However, the app itself is insanely buggy. It's trash. Simply getting to the list of lessons in the course requires me to go back to the home screen and select the course all over again, which just ends up bringing up the video that's already playing. Then my video player will get locked in full screen mode. I literally have to close the app and reopen JUST to select a different video in the SAME course. So stupid."", ""This app I a HUGE disappointment. It has very limited settings. Videos automatically when you click on a course and you can't turn it off. It gives you the option to use an SD card, tells you it saving to it, but when you check the SD card in settings, it's all saved to internal storage, and then refuses to save to the SD card once it has eaten up all your internal storage. They also don't have in-app assistance or issue reporting. The website they want you to use is primitive a pain to use."", ""I like the course, but the app is probably the worst thing I've ever used on a phone. Want to download videos or the whole course? no problem you can do that, but you certainly can not play those downloaded videos if you have little or no internet connection. try uninstalling, reinstalling, airplane mode, jump through hoops and stop being able to get texts, because these guys are terrified of piracy and can't come up with a secure way to deal with it. streaming sites pull if off, but not udemy"", 'Courses are ok. There are two thing I dont like though. Casting the video lectures to Chromecast always results in the very first video of the whole course being played. To know how long a particular section is going to take to finish, you have to manually add the time taken by all the videos in that section. Why not show the time each section takes in total? This has been a pain everytime I sit to plan my studies and come up with a timeline to finish the course.', 'Can\'t download your course? You can fix the ""trying to download, crashes app"" in v7.20.1 (this is current info as of 1/31/22) by downloading each course lesson individually. Yes, it\'s a pain to do. But at least you can have the courses offline. The 3* is reflective of the fact to remedy this issue I had to comb through the support comments. The app, content, and overall user experience (minus this incredibly annoying bug) has been great, otherwise.', 'Suggested improvements for the app 1. While playing on 2x speed, audio on videos produces weird noises. I tested this on the website as well. Only downloaded videos do not have this problem 2. When switching to full screen mode, video should be able to rotate to the orientation which the user has held his phone. Sometimes the video shows up upside down', ""Despite downloading the videos, it still uses the data when viewing it. I have to physically turn off my data service in order to use the downloaded video. Also, it always automatically plays a video after clicking on a course. It doesn't not give me the option to pause it immediately, only after the video loads and waste a few seconds of playtime. Lastly, the video continues playing in the background, despite closing the application and going to another app. I would hope the video pauses."", ""More concerned with anti-piracy measures than facilitating learning. Can't screenshot slides from videos (changes to a black screen), closes when you switch to a note taking app, plays the wrong video when you return, downloads break more often than not (4 of the last 36 attempts worked), and overall unresponsive. A video that I downloaded that worked yesterday no longer works today. It's a mess. But hey, at least I can't steal the content I'm paying for."", ""Great content, garbage app. Constant connection and sign-in problems! Can log in on phone, but not tablet (credentials are saved to password manager on both devices, wont work with/without vpn). Can't log in with a VPN on any device, 2 different VPNs tried. Udemy, I love your content, but this app is trash. I've contacted support, no response or they can't fix it. Pluralsight is looking better and better..."", ""I do like Udemy but I don't use it as much as I would like to because I'm not always able to get an internet connection. Luckily, Udemy has added the ability to install courses so I don't have to bootleg the courses I paid for. Unfortunately, this feature only works with Android/iOS and it does not save to the SD card even though there is an option for it. So, I can't install my courses onto my Chromebook as it doesn't have a lot of internal memory."", ""Casting is extremely busted, was hoping to use it for learning while running on treadmill but have tried multiple times. It keeps jumping to a previous video, no way to even skip ahead when it's casting to even work around it going to a previous lesson. Auto advance doesn't work either in casting. I have a unifi network with the access point near, new 4k Chromecast and pixel 6 so it isn't my equipment as I can cast multi other apps with zero issues. Can't get around with screen mirror either."", 'It cannot cast to Chromecast. I\'ve attempted to cast to three devices from my Pixel 6 Pro with same result. The target device displays ""Waiting for the Lecture"" but it never comes. The app displays ""There was a problem with Chromecast. Please try again"". I can cast to the same devices from YouTube, etc., the problem is not with Chromecast. Update: The support agent said paid courses cannot be cast. Claimed casting support is a myth. What\'s the point of showing cast button?', ""That it takes *forever* to load and play lectures when I have poor connectivity is a huge pain. I pre-dowloaded the lectures so that poor connectivity wouldn't be a problem but the app takes ~60 seconds to load and then ~20 seconds for a cached video to start playing is pretty embarrassing. Otherwise, I'm enjoying the course I bought!"", ""Even after several updates, this app is still garbage. Poor app experience, videos jump ahead, casting is inconsistent, controls to play, skip ahead or back don't work sometimes while casting. Inconsistency with app remembering where you left off in a course. Overall it's extremely buggy as there are too many issues to list. Casting is completely broken. App needs to be thoroughly tested and bugs worked out before releasing to users."", ""Awesome app over all. Has a few bugs that could be worked out of it. My only real problem I've had was when I have a few courses downloaded the app would crash in low service areas. If you only download 1 course at a time you should be good though. Fix that and the app would be perfect."", ""App plays videos out of order and frequently says there are issues with casting to Chromecast devices. Ran into these issues on two separate Android devices as well as two separate Chromecast devices (Vizio smartcast and Google TV device). Had to switch to use their website since the mobile app is having trouble. Guessing there is no QA or that they aren't being thorough in their testing."", ""Casting/mirroring option buggy. When I cast (option within app) what's on the screen to a device, it plays a random lesson, not what's on screen. When I use the screen mirroring option (option on my phone), it shows everything on my screen but the actual video playing. It's a just a black square but the correct lesson is playing and I can see everything else on the screen just fine. I'm using an adroid device."", ""Don't use if you plan to Chromecast. I'm watching a series of lectures and numbers 10 and 11 (so far) won't cast. The app shows #9 and then jumps to #12. When I contacted support, they said (quite rudely) that it's not avaiable for all lectures. This makes no sense. Why is the Cast icon even showing for lectures that supposedly won't work?"", ""I have used this app for a few years now and it still surprises me how many bugs there still are. The most common that I run across everytime I use it is one that will randomly start playing the next video (and it will sometimes check mark the original video you were watching for you, making it hard to tell what you've missed). Udemy itself is great, but they clearly need some new people on the app development team."", ""Developers need to look at issues that we address here. Video from the index jumps to different ones, and it didn't happen on the browser. Video is unable to cast to Google Chrome, app display error while GChrome displays waiting for the lecture. I cleared cached, uninstalled, reinstalled, and it is still happening. I need to cast the lecture to my TV because I want to watch the video while having hands-on experience. Please fix the issue. Thank you."", ""The course was $14.99, but when added it to the cart and went to check out the price was changed to $89.99. Also, all courses were about $15, I logged out and logged back in 5 mins later and all of the prices were increased by A LOT! At this point I'm not yet sure if this was a technical difficulty or company's tricky greed. 🤔"", ""Over all the courses are good and there is a fair amount of courses to pick from. Offline is non existent. If you dont have a net connection it will not play offline downloaded courses. The auto play when you open a course also SUCKS. I use two devices to view my courses. Sometimes the other device doesn't update right and it will AUTO play the wrong one. You also cant just jump into the course to view notes without it autoplaying.... which if your offline will crash the app."", ""For being an education platform, this Udemy app should be top notch and easy to navigate. The latter is true. This app has great potential to go from mediocre to awesome if you would fix little annoying things. For example you could fix the issue of the 'load more' button not functioning on the mobile phone app. I use the Galaxy Note Plus and I don't see my other courses because the app won't load them all. Please fix."", ""Edit 2: This app is not usable even on my phone anymore. I can't watch any videos, downloaded or not. I am connected to the internet and YouTube works perfectly. I can't put up with this anymore. Time to start using Coursera again. Edit: I can't see half of my courses on my tablet. Original: Video loading is extremely slow, much worse than YouTube. It's possible to download content, so that's good. But the app is a bit clunky. 3/5 overall."", ""Overall, I'm a fan of this app. I love being able to watch courses on my phone or cast them to my TV and it has many of the features that I liked with the browser version. But it still needs some work. The autoplay is random at best. Sometimes it will play several in a row and then suddenly need me to click on the lesson to load it. Other times it doesn't autoplay at all. Worst is when it decides to start an episode several minutes in and I have to go in and fix it. A decent app but not perfect."", ""The actual service udemy provides is great. It's a good way to learn new skills from insightful people, for a very affordable price. That said, the app is garbage. Yes, the videos take forever to load and don't play well, just like other reviewers have commented. But what's worse is that the app is incredibly difficult to navigate, classes are difficult to search for, and there are multiple courses which I have purchased that just don't appear at all on the mobile version."", ""A very good platform to learn new things, I passed my Comptia exams with the Total Seminar courses. I highly recommend Udemy.  My issue is with the app itself and the ads that pop up. There's nothing more annoying than a pop-up ad in the middle of a lecture of a course I paid for.    This seems to only happen on the App, I would recommend that anyone using it just download the lessons and play them in Airplane mode or just access them through a browser."", 'So far, so awesome! Just started my first course. Life coaching, no real direction in mind to use this practically, just wanted to know more about the subject. Great layout and lots of information. I\'d say it pays to do side research on the instructors prior to purchase, as I did see some ""quacks"". Be smart and think about the content before just jumping into a course.', 'Excellent interface, videos work well, and all around good e perience. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I have to jump to a PC to review course documents or to take quizzes. I understand that, depending on the topic, some content requires a PC, but I think I should be able to read notes/documents and take quizzes on my phone.']",False,"['org.coursera.android', 'com.linkedin.android.learning', 'org.domestika', 'org.edx.mobile', 'com.skillshare.Skillshare']","['com.udemy.android.ufb', 'com.udemy.android.ufg']",com.udemy.android,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.udemy.android&hl=en&gl=us

It does not allow for screen rotation, so video presentation is limited to whatever the width (not length) of your screen is. It has an option for audio only, so you can cut back cell data usage while you\'re just listening. While using cell data, it also unexpectedly pauses, skips, and decides that you\'re done with a lecture while there are still several minutes to go. I haven\'t noticed this with WiFi data, but also haven\'t given it a thorough testing. Probably the second-most annoying part is that the app wants to launch every time I unlock my phone. I have absolutely no idea why. TL;DR? Sure you\'re going to be able to get your Great Courses stuff. Aside from that, it needs a lot of work. I\'d say ""one star, would not recommend"" except that the primary function works.', 'I LOVE the great courses. However, their apps have been lagged and not well designed. One good example is that I have to click individual episodes and download them. The app designers could have provided an option to download an entire course with just one click. Also, it is hard to know if a download has started or not. Wondrium app is still buggy and laggy. Hope it soon falls into the hands of good developers and designers', 'The library of courses from The Great Courses is great to have, but this mobile app is lacking in two quality of life features and fixes that would make it great. The first one is playback continuing after turning off the phone or putting the phone on standby. Both audio and video playback stop after pressing the power button to turn the display off. Audio playback continues for a few minutes and then stops. Video playback stops immediately. The second is keeping captions on downloaded videos.', '06/25/2021: Video plays for only a few seconds, then stops- as if ""paused"". To resume playing I have to click the video and press the ""play"" icon. Then it plays a few seconds and pauses again. This infuriating behavior occurs for both live streaming and downloaded video playback. This doesn\'t happen on the iPad, only on Android on my Samsung Galaxy S9+. Update: 02/12/2022. No resolution. This apps completely sux on Android, and no help from Wondrium. Just lame responses.', ""The content is fantastic but there are some minor complaints. I wish there was a way to see subcategories of subjects. I also would like it if there was a feature that allowed me to view the introductions to various courses in quick succession, sort of like an educational version of TikTok. It'd be a cool way to explore different courses without having to manually search for everything."", 'If I could leave zero stars, I would. Since becoming Wondrium we can no longer stream through Roku to use our subscription or access our previously purchased great courses. We tried reloading, changing the password, etc. Nothing worked. We contacted customer service. They apologized for the inconvenience, confirmed that we had paid our subscription and it is paid for the next 3 months (quarterly billing plan) but offered no help in fixing the problem. Used to be a good service, now it is a scam. Nov 17th Update: Thank you for trying to help. Yes, we knew they were two different Roku channels. When you go to the Great Courses the channel tells you to go to the Great Courses Plus channel. Then when you try to load Great Courses Plus, Roku says there is no such channel. The Great Course Plus channel is what we had that worked fine, until it switched to Wondrium.', ""Basically gives you free college courses on your own time from home! If you call Wondrium (before signing up) they'll give you a code to pay 1/2 price forever! Works on my Roku, firestick, & Android. When I use on my Android, app gives you choice of video or audio only. Listening with audio allows my screen to go dark while still playing. New courses always being added, a favorite list, & great search option. A+"", ""I like this service. There doesn't seem to be another like it. While other learning apps focus on career advancement, this app is for people who just like to learn new things. I was one of those weird people who enjoyed being in class more than partying while at college, and this service captures what is like to be in class. I really enjoy being engrossed in lectures by professors who are knowledgeable and passionate about what they teach."", ""Why is the quality so bad? Video quality seems to cap at 720p, which honestly is fine for me, but the audio sounds so bad most of the time. There is no question that there is a great wealth of information here, if you can grit through it. It's like Audible quality, tuned smartly for voice to sound okay at low bandwidth, but distractingly bad when you notice it. It also keeps telling me I'm not on wifi and interrupting my viewing when I def am on my home wifi. The constant popups say otherwise."", ""Content: 5 stars. App performance: 0 stars. Trying to cast from my phone to my Vizio TV with Chromecast/Google Assistant built in fails. On courses with the audio option it plays the audio, but on video-only courses it refuses to play. On my TV. 😒 I'm paying for this subscription specifically to use in our homeschool, so only watching it on my phone is NOT a viable option."", 'I was a heavy user of the previous version of this app and it was great! I love The Great Courses Plus and the app was simple but effective. Now the new version, I\'ll admit, is certainly more aesthetically appealing. Being able to collapse different course titles in the ""Downloads"" view is helpful, and I like having quick access to the PDF course guides. However, this version also took a few steps backwards: 1) Why can\'t we store videos on SD card anymore? Will TGC bring that back or has it been permanently removed? The videos take up a LOT of space and I was running low as it was. 2) Now all videos play with the status bar and button bar permanently visible instead of in full-screen view. Could you please at least provide a setting so users can choose whether they want full-screen or non-full-screen playback? 3) Whenever I\'m downloading a video for offline playback all the images on the screen start flashing. Not a problem but annoying and looks unprofessional.', ""2020-04-16 (revised to 3 stars) The folks at Great Courses Plus are obviously working on improving the user experience and have made a significant progress over the past 2 weeks. The latest version of the app (version 5.2) times out less frequently and hasn't crashed on me yet. Therefore, the original 1 star review is no longer warranted. There is still room for improvement, but kudos to TGC for the progress so far. 2020-04-04 (original review) The 1-star review is for the new release of the Android app and the lack of support for it. First general problems: The app hangs, crashes, and will go into spinner mode until you exit and restart it. This happens multiple times daily. And when it's not doing those things, it can be painfully slow. I suspect much of the slowness is due to a new back-end system implemented by the Great Courses. Things have gotten substantially worse after the upgrade to the new system (when all of the device passwords were reset). Specific bugs: 1) Speaking of passwords, the Android app has a 20 character limit for the password, even though the website will allow you to configure a longer password. There's no warning about this website. I had to figure it out the hard way. 2) The app allows you to download content so you don't have to stream and incur data plan charges. But inexplicably (I think because they never tested this), when you start to play downloaded content while not connected to wi-fi, you get a pop-up warning you that you need to change settings to allow data streaming because you're not connected to wi-fi. But this is the whole point of downloading content. And if you try to exit popup, you have either changed the setting (which I don't want to do - I downloaded the content because I *don't* want to stream over my data plan) or you haven't changed it and playback stops. So I just leave the dialog open and then app eventually crashes once I'm back in wi-fi range. Great... I haven't received a response to any of my recent attempts to contact Customer Service. As a long-time customer of The Teaching Company / The Great Courses (since the time when courses were sent out on cassette tapes) this is disappointing. They used to have very good, responsive customer service. It's a shame because the app and customer service are so bad that I'm ready to cancel."", ""I love the Great Courses, and based upon the content, I was planning on extending past the 30 day trial. However, I'm not sure I will. On my Samsung phone, it pauses every couple of minutes and gets really annoying to keep pressing play. This could be very dangerous for those that try to listen and drive. Also, on my phone, I have to exit the app a couple times in order for my content to appear. The roku app won't keep you signed in so it takes a while to sign in and it's really annoying."", ""The content is great. The app is a little slow and buggy sometimes but that's not a huge deal. The problem I had was strange and was never resolved. I did the free trial with intensions to renew and pay full price the next month. The next month rolled around and I was charged for the subscription, but my account was deactivated. I emailed the team to try getting this figured out and they still haven't fixed this. They refunded me, and they told me they'd fix it but it's been almost a month."", 'The app loses all my information llike Favorites or Downloads when it remains dormant for a period of time. I have to kill the app and restart it and it then remembers everything. In the past I had trouble accessing downloaded courses when I did not have an internet connection. It wants to reverify that you are an active member. I have not tested the latest version. Other than that, the app is great!. Finding, accessing and streaming a huge range of courses.', 'I love the material offered by The Great Courses, but the app has some issues. 1. Several days ago, I downloaded some lectures to listen while on a trip with limited internet access. Upon opening the app, I was greeted with the message ""We have made some changes that require you to upgrade to our latest version"" with no option to continue until the app was upgraded. Very annoying, and kind of defeats the whole purpose of downloading lectures. 2. During playback of lectures, the player will randomly pause, requiring me to manually restart. 3. No Android Auto support for audio lectures.', ""It's nice being able to take the courses with you on the go. The audio-only option allows me to listen in the car during my commutes. My only issue is I wish the size of the closed captions was adjustable. It is so teeny tiny on my S9 that it's pointless to try to use them. I don't really use this app as much as I would like because of this. I have a slight auditory processing issue and watching things with captions is very helpful for me."", ""Update: I added a star. The app is no longer struggling to load and play audio and video. Previous: The app itself is nice. But it really seems to struggle with audio and network interruptions - phone and sms. I've had to go as far as force stopping and purging local content to get it running normally again. It's unfortunate because it makes the product hard to enjoy."", ""Love the great courses but the app is terrible! Every single time I try to go back to where I left off it locks up, just loading forever. Occasionally I can do a search but cannot use the back button so no way to navigate to the menu, I just have to restart the app and loading in general is very slow so I'm never quite certain if I need to wait it out or restart. Once I actually get to the lectures playing audios/videos seems to work well."", 'The service is awesome but this app is an exercise in frustration. I will start a lecture and listen as I clean the house but invariably playback will stop and I have to pull out my phone, pause, then play again. It also never goes on to the next lecture without me having to do the same. It often stops playing new lectures altogether after two or three. Then I have to actually kill the app and restart it. This happens when downloading the lectures, too. It is pretty to look at, but I wish they had put more effort into smooth, reliable operation.', ""Best new feature: you can now download lectures in audio and listen offline. (Before, you could only download video lectures.) The app now marks your place in each lecture, even if you skip between lectures or courses. It now freezes much less often. If it gets wonky or slow, try restarting your phone. If you need to pause for more than a few minutes, quit the app and restart it when you're back. If you press play after pausing too long, it drops you at a random point in an earlier lecture."", ""Excellent value for the money. I listen to lectures in audio format when I'm driving for work and watch the videos when I have time at home. Seamless transitions between the two make it possible to keep up no matter what you're doing. I've learned so much thanks to these guys from Great Courses and Wondrium is just a step up in content. The only downside is poor app integration across devices. Don't count on seeing this on flex boxes, game consoles, or some other streaming devices."", ""Great content. Horrible app. Audio courses will play for 20 seconds and then stop so you have to keep pressing play every 20 seconds to get through the lecture. I thought the newest update would fix this, but it actually made it worse. Too many times I've opened the app to listen to a course and it simply wouldn't load. For a few days the app said I wasn't a member and didn't have access to the content. Really disappointing. I paid for a 3 month subscription and can't access anything."", ""There's so much content, and such a wide variety of lectures and courses to choose from along with guidebooks. Another awesome feature that's extremely useful for me is the ability to quickly switch from video format to audio format whenever I have to go somewhere or do something. My only recommended improvement would be to add something like a monthly credit to buy a singular lecture or course, and own it forever. Similar to Audible. All in all, great app. Recommend it a lot. 👍"", 'I love the Great Courses and was excited to subscribe to the Great Courses Plus. The content is excellent and the app is nicely designed. Unfortunately, I am unable to actually watch any video using the App. I have an app that runs in the background and updates information on my pull down menu every 5 minutes. Every time it updates, this App pauses the video or audio that is currently playing. Please try to fix this. If the app would automatically resume playing, it would be better. Thanks', 'The updated app includes the ability to download audio versions of each lecture, plus the associated guidebook. These are terrific improvements over the former version. Moreover, the functionality and user interface are great. However, I would still like to see the capability to download all lectures in a course with one button instead of clicking on all individually.', ""I really do not like this app. When it works it works well. When it screws up it does a great job! If your multi-tasking with this app you can forget about it. I paused my lecture, used GPS for around 15mins then went back to lecture and my lecture was gone. I had to restart and it doesn't restart from the beginning but it also doesn't restart from where it was initially paused either. That problem is bothersome but the app will aslo go as far as freezing up and will become unresponsive."", ""I like all the content the app has, however it's a little buggy. If I'm locking my screen , I can pause the app from the lock screen. However, if I click play from the lock screen, Not only does the course I want to listen to play, but also some random course I was listening too previously also starts playing. It's a little frustrating to have to open the app each time I want to resume my course"", ""I love the courses (selection and content), but the platform is terrible. I stream the courses at home and in my car. If I don't remember to open the app before leaving home, it does not recognize my ID and password when I try to use it in the car. When away from home,, I can't close the app because I have the same problem. Some of the older courses don't have an audio only option which uses more data if you stream them in your car. All the courses should have an audio only option."", ""The app used to be pretty bad and had a difficult to use UI. Also couldn't delete individual downloaded lectures, you had to delete a whole course of downloaded lectures. All these issues are now gone and the app runs much more smoothly now after an update that came out a late last year. Only thing I can think of that needs to change is making all lectures available for audio download, as I think there are still some that are available for video download only."", ""The content is wonderful. The app is not. It rarely remembers where I am in a lecture series, both within a given lecture and where I left off between them. It says that you can save the lectures to your SD card, but you can't. Also, the opening screen should be my watchlist, not some random collections of lectures in which I have no interest."", ""Edit: reduced to 1 star. After more than 2 years and hundreds of hours of lectures, I'm removing the app and canceling my subscription. Audio streaming has been failing to load with increasing frequency over the last year, and has now become entirely non-functional. Same issue on iphone X and Samsung S20+. Verizon, tmobile, wifi, all the same. I have one course to finish in video mode and I'll be canceling my subscription, and it's a real shame."", 'As the others said, the content is great. The lecturers are good, and the topics are many and interesting. The applications (be that on Win 10, Fire or Android) leave a lot to be desired. There is no consistency across the board (which happens when someone hires different contractors to build them without having an overall standard), and unfortunately the android app is just useless in my case because I cannot listen to the lectures, only watch them. Cancelled my subscription after an year.', ""Great content let down by a bad app: * You can download content, but you must be online to access (why bother?). * You cannot download audio only for many lectures, leading to needlessly big downloads/data. * When you download the video and let your screen sleep, the audio stops. * There's no easy way to see where you left off. * Way too much focus on video for what is great audio content. * No Android TV support at all. All in all, there's a lot that feels poorly thought out and woefully executed. The inability to play content offline is absurd. All the major streaming services have that figured out, but here it's a mess. I still kinda recommend the overall product, but the app makes it absolutely painful. It's a mess."", 'Good content. Greatest problem is that you cannot download the audio of a video course. Thus you have to stream it if you are away from wifi; not good if you have a limited data plan. Downloading the video and playing it later would work but for my battery being more quickly depleted by playing the video just to listen, not watch. May quit when my free trial is up.', ""This app has been amazing, there are so many learning opportunities. I've been listening mainly to history lectures as I work from home but there is so much more I'd love to dive deeper into when I have time. There was recently an issue where my subscription was canceled without my input but they helped me sort that out. Something to do with Google play, not the apps fault. Point being, they have always been very helpful to me when I need it."", ""TL;DR Wonderful learning tool if the audio playback worked consistently. App content has been great so far, but it's good I'm on a free trial because the audio playback is buggy. I drive truck so I want to be able to listen to audio in the background, but I often can't get it to start playing... The loading spinner spins and spins, but no audio. If I choose video, it normally starts in ten seconds or so, but then it stops playing when I send the app to background. It's an irritating Catch 22."", 'If you installed the upgrade that was pushed out on 2/12/2020 and are stalled at the sign in screen (just a spinning circle and the words, ""Signing In""), try going first to the ""Browse Courses"" option at the bottom of the screen and then use the sign in button that is available there. That was the only way I could get past the stalled ""Signing In"" screen that came up whenever I tried to sign in directly from the starting screen. Love The Great Courses Plus. Still room for improvements to the mobile app, but they\'re working on it.', ""The content is genuinely top-notch (I'm often quite surprised by the production quality) and had a wide variety of topics to choose from. The app is a little slow and sometimes buggy, but I expect it'll improve in time. Pricing is kind of expensive, but they're making new courses regularly so it doesn't seem like such a waste to me. I'm overall very happy with Wondrium."", ""Fantastic but dated. Catalogue is huge and the speakers well selected. My only complaint, and unfortunately it's a big one, is how dated all these lectures are. The ones I've listened to are all from the 2000's. Much has changed and been discovered since than. I'm left to wonder how come these arent being rerecorded every few years.
